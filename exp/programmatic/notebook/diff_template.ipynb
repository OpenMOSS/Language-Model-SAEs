Hmm, that seems a bit complex, but let me break it down step by step.\\n\\nFirst, let\\'s parse the problem statement again. We have pairs (m, n) with m > n, and for each k from 1 up to m - n, the gcd(n + k, m + k) should be 1. Wait, actually, the way it\\'s written is from gcd(n+1, m+1) to gcd(m, 2m - n). Let me check how many terms there are here.\\n\\nStarting with gcd(n+1, m+1): the first term is when we add 1 to both n and m. Then the next is gcd(n+2, m+2), and so on, up to gcd(m, 2m - n). Let me see how many terms this is. The first part is n+1, and the last part is m. So the number of terms is m - (n + 1) + 1 = m - n. Similarly, on the m side, the first term is m+1, and the last term is 2m - n. Let\\'s verify the number of terms here: (2m - n) - (m + 1) + 1 = 2m - n - m - 1 + 1 = m - n. So both sequences have m - n terms. Therefore, we have m - n gcd conditions that must all be equal to 1.\\n\\nSo, we need that for each integer k from 1 to m - n, gcd(n + k, m + k) = 1. Let me try to express m in terms of n and some difference. Let\\'s let d = m - n, since m > n, d is a positive integer. Then m = n + d. Let me substitute m with n + d in the equations. So, the pairs are (n + d, n) where n and d are positive integers, and we need gcd(n + k, n + d + k) = 1 for all k from 1 to d.\\n\\nWait, substituting m = n + d, then for each k from 1 to d, we have gcd(n + k, (n + d) + k) = gcd(n + k, n + k + d) = gcd(n + k, d). Because gcd(a, a + d) = gcd(a, d). Is that right? Let me confirm: gcd(a, a + d) = gcd(a, d). Yes, because any common divisor of a and a + d must divide their difference, which is d. So, indeed, gcd(a, a + d) = gcd(a, d). Therefore, in our case, gcd(n + k, d) = 1 for all k from 1 to d.\\n\\nBut n + k runs from n + 1 to n + d. So, we need that all integers from n + 1 to n + d are coprime with d. Therefore, for each integer x in the interval [n + 1, n + d], gcd(x, d) = 1.\\n\\nSo, this reduces the problem to finding all positive integers n and d such that every number from n + 1 to n + d is coprime with d. Then m = n + d, so our pairs would be (n + d, n).\\n\\nTherefore, the key is to find d and n such that n + 1, n + 2, ..., n + d are all coprime with d. So, what does this mean?\\n\\nIf all numbers from n + 1 to n + d are coprime with d, then none of these numbers can share a common factor with d greater than 1. So, in other words, d must be such that in any block of d consecutive integers, there exists some number divisible by a prime factor of d. Wait, but here we are choosing the block starting at n + 1, so we need that none of these numbers share a prime factor with d.\\n\\nAlternatively, for each prime p dividing d, none of the numbers n + 1, ..., n + d can be divisible by p. Therefore, for each prime p | d, the interval [n + 1, n + d] must not contain any multiple of p. But if d is the length of the interval, and p divides d, then p ≤ d. So, how can an interval of length d not contain a multiple of p? Since p divides d, but p ≤ d. Wait, in an interval of length d, starting at n + 1, if p divides d, then the numbers in the interval would be n + 1, n + 2, ..., n + d. If p divides d, then the spacing between multiples of p is p, so in any d consecutive numbers, since d is a multiple of p, there must be exactly d/p multiples of p. But if d is a multiple of p, then in an interval of d consecutive numbers, there are exactly d/p multiples of p. So unless n is chosen such that the interval [n + 1, n + d] skips all multiples of p. But if p divides d, then in such an interval, since d is a multiple of p, the numbers wrap around modulo p, so there must be a multiple of p in the interval. Wait, that seems conflicting.\\n\\nWait, more carefully: Consider that d is divisible by p. Then in any d consecutive integers, how many multiples of p are there? Exactly d/p, since every p-th number is a multiple. So, for example, if d = p, then there is exactly one multiple of p in any block of p consecutive numbers. Therefore, if we want an interval of length d (which is divisible by p) with no multiples of p, that\\'s impossible. Because in such an interval, you must have exactly d/p multiples, which would be at least 1. Therefore, if d has a prime factor p, then in any interval of d consecutive numbers, there is at least one multiple of p, hence gcd of that number with d would be at least p, which is greater than 1. Therefore, for the gcd(n + k, d) to be 1 for all k from 1 to d, it must be that d has no prime factors. But the only positive integer with no prime factors is 1. Therefore, d must be 1. Wait, that seems too restrictive. Let me check this reasoning again.\\n\\nSuppose d is a prime number, say d = p. Then in any interval of p consecutive numbers, there must be exactly one multiple of p. Hence, in the interval [n + 1, n + p], there is exactly one multiple of p. Therefore, unless that multiple is excluded, but since the interval has length p, we can\\'t avoid it. Therefore, if d is prime, then for any n, the interval [n + 1, n + p] contains exactly one multiple of p, so gcd of that number with p would be p, which is not 1. Hence, to have all gcds equal to 1, d must be 1. Because if d = 1, then the interval is just [n + 1], and gcd(n + 1, 1) is 1, since gcd any number with 1 is 1. Therefore, d = 1 is allowed.\\n\\nBut wait, if d = 1, then m = n + 1, and the only gcd to check is gcd(n + 1, m + 1) = gcd(n + 1, n + 2) = 1, which is always true. So, for any n, m = n + 1 is a solution. But the problem says \"determine all pairs m > n\", so if d = 1, then all pairs where m = n + 1 would work. But according to our earlier reasoning, if d has any prime factor, then in the interval [n + 1, n + d] there must be a multiple of that prime, hence gcd > 1. Therefore, d must be 1. Therefore, the only possible pairs are those with m = n + 1.\\n\\nWait, but let\\'s test with d = 2. Suppose d = 2. Then we need that n + 1 and n + 2 are both coprime with 2. So, gcd(n + 1, 2) = 1 and gcd(n + 2, 2) = 1. But n + 1 and n + 2 are consecutive integers. One of them must be even. Hence, one of the gcds would be 2, which is not 1. Therefore, d = 2 is impossible. Similarly, d = 3. Suppose d = 3. Then we need n + 1, n + 2, n + 3 all coprime with 3. So, in three consecutive numbers, none can be divisible by 3. But in any three consecutive numbers, exactly one is divisible by 3. Hence, impossible. Similarly, for d = 4. The interval [n + 1, n + 4] must have no even numbers? But since it\\'s four consecutive numbers, two of them are even. Hence, gcd with 4 would be at least 2. Therefore, impossible. Therefore, indeed, only d = 1 works. Hence, all pairs where m = n + 1 satisfy the condition.\\n\\nWait, but let me check a specific example. Let\\'s take d = 1. Then m = n + 1. Then we have to check gcd(n + 1, m + 1) = gcd(n + 1, n + 2) = 1, which is true because consecutive numbers are coprime. Since d = 1, there\\'s only one gcd to check. Therefore, this works.\\n\\nBut let\\'s test with d = 1, n = 1: m = 2. Check gcd(2, 3) = 1, which is good. Similarly, n = 2, m = 3: gcd(3, 4) = 1. So that works. So, indeed, all consecutive integer pairs satisfy the condition. But is that the only solution?\\n\\nWait, but let\\'s try d = 1, n = 1, m = 2: works. What if d = 2? Let me see if there\\'s any n where n + 1 and n + 2 are both coprime with 2. But in two consecutive numbers, one is even, so one of them would have gcd 2 with 2, which is not 1. Hence, no solution for d = 2.\\n\\nSimilarly, d = 3: need three consecutive numbers all coprime with 3. But in three consecutive numbers, one is divisible by 3, so that one would have gcd 3 with 3. Hence, no solution for d = 3.\\n\\nSo, in general, for d ≥ 2, since d has at least one prime factor, and in the interval [n + 1, n + d], there must be a multiple of each prime factor of d, hence making the gcd greater than 1. Therefore, only d = 1 works, leading to m = n + 1.\\n\\nTherefore, all pairs where m = n + 1 satisfy the given condition. But let me check if there\\'s another possibility where d is not 1, but maybe composite? Let\\'s take d = 6. Then, the prime factors are 2 and 3. In any interval of 6 consecutive numbers, there must be multiples of 2 and 3. For example, in [n + 1, n + 6], there are 3 even numbers, so gcd with 6 would be 2 or 3 or 6, so definitely not all 1. Hence, d = 6 is invalid.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe if d is a prime power? Let\\'s take d = 4 (which is 2^2). Then, in an interval of 4 numbers, we have two even numbers, so gcd with 4 would be at least 2 for those. So, again, not all 1.\\n\\nTherefore, it seems that only d = 1 works. Therefore, all pairs are m = n + 1. Hence, the solution is all consecutive integers with m = n + 1.\\n\\nWait, but let me check a case where d = 1. For example, n = 1, m = 2: gcd(2, 3) = 1. That works. n = 2, m = 3: gcd(3, 4) = 1. Also works. What about n = 3, m = 4: gcd(4, 5) = 1. Yes. So, all consecutive pairs. But the problem says \"all pairs m > n\", so this would be an infinite set of pairs where m is exactly one more than n.\\n\\nBut the problem says \"determine all pairs\", so the answer is all pairs where m = n + 1. Therefore, the solution is m = n + 1 for any positive integer n.\\n\\nBut wait, let me check the original problem again. The gcds start from gcd(n + 1, m + 1) up to gcd(m, 2m - n). So when m = n + 1, the last gcd is gcd(n + 1, 2(n + 1) - n) = gcd(n + 1, n + 2) = 1. Which is consistent. So, even the last gcd is 1. So, in this case, all the gcds are between consecutive integers, which are always coprime.\\n\\nTherefore, the conclusion is that all pairs where m = n + 1 satisfy the condition. Are there any other pairs?\\n\\nWait, let me test with m = n + 2, n = 1, m = 3. Then we need to check gcd(2, 4) = 2, which is not 1. So that fails. What about m = n + 3, n = 1, m = 4. Check gcd(2, 5) = 1, gcd(3, 6) = 3, which fails. So, only when m = n +1 does this hold.\\n\\nAlternatively, take m = n + 1. Then the sequence of gcds is gcd(n + 1, n + 2), gcd(n + 2, n + 3), ..., gcd(n + (m - n), n + (m - n) + (m - n)). Wait, when m = n +1, the difference d =1, so only one gcd: gcd(n +1, m +1) = gcd(n +1, n + 2) =1, which is correct.\\n\\nTherefore, yes, it seems that the only solutions are pairs where m = n +1.\\n\\nBut wait, let me think again. Suppose n and m are such that m = n +1. Then, the set of gcds required is from gcd(n +1, n + 2) up to gcd(n + (m -n), 2m -n). Since m -n =1, so only one gcd: gcd(n +1, 2(n +1) -n) = gcd(n +1, n +2) =1. So, indeed, it works.\\n\\nBut could there be a case where m -n is greater than1, but all the gcds still equal 1? For example, take m =5, n =2. Then m -n =3. So, the gcds to check are:\\n\\ngcd(3,6)=3, which is not 1. So, fails.\\n\\nAnother example: m =4, n=1. Then gcd(2,5)=1, gcd(3,6)=3≠1. So, fails.\\n\\nWait, how about m =5, n=3. Then d =2. The gcds are gcd(4,6)=2 and gcd(5,7)=1. So, first gcd is 2≠1, so invalid.\\n\\nAlternatively, m = 5, n=4. Then d=1. gcd(5,6)=1. That works.\\n\\nAnother example: m=6, n=5. d=1. gcd(6,7)=1. Works.\\n\\nBut if I take d=2, m =n +2, say n=5, m=7. Then check gcd(6,8)=2≠1, gcd(7,9)=1. So, first gcd fails.\\n\\nAlternatively, n=1, m=3. gcd(2,4)=2≠1. So, invalid.\\n\\nWait, so indeed, whenever d ≥2, the first gcd(n +1, m +1)=gcd(n +1, n + d +1)=gcd(n +1, d). Since m =n +d. Wait, gcd(n +1, n + d +1) = gcd(n +1, (n + d +1) - (n +1)) = gcd(n +1, d). So, to have gcd(n +1, d) =1. Similarly, the next gcd(n +2, m +2) = gcd(n +2, d) =1, and so on up to gcd(n +d, 2m -n) = gcd(n +d, 2(n +d) -n)=gcd(n +d, n +2d)=gcd(n +d, d).\\n\\nWait, so actually, when m =n +d, the problem reduces to gcd(n +k, d) =1 for k=1 to d. So, all numbers from n +1 to n +d must be coprime with d.\\n\\nBut if d has any prime factor p, then in the interval [n +1, n +d], there must be a multiple of p. However, if n is congruent to -k mod p for some k in 1 to d, then n +k ≡0 mod p. Therefore, unless n ≡ -1, -2, ..., -d mod p, which is equivalent to n ≡ p -1, p -2, ..., p -d mod p. But if d ≥p, then p -d ≤0, so n would have to be in a certain residue class mod p. Wait, this might not be possible for all primes p dividing d.\\n\\nAlternatively, for each prime p dividing d, the numbers n +1, ..., n +d must not be divisible by p. But in an interval of d consecutive numbers, if p divides d, then since p ≤d, there must be a multiple of p in that interval. Therefore, if p divides d, then such an interval cannot avoid having a multiple of p, hence gcd(n +k, d) ≥p >1 for some k. Therefore, d must not have any prime factors, i.e., d=1. Therefore, the only solution is d=1, leading to m =n +1.\\n\\nTherefore, the conclusion is that all pairs where m =n +1 are the only solutions. Therefore, the answer is all pairs of consecutive positive integers where m =n +1.\\n\\nBut let me confirm with another approach. Suppose m =n +1. Then the conditions require gcd(n +1, n +2)=1, which is true. Also, the last gcd is gcd(m, 2m -n)=gcd(n +1, 2(n +1) -n)=gcd(n +1, n +2)=1. Since m -n =1, there\\'s only one gcd to check. So that works.\\n\\nIf m =n +d where d ≥2, then as we saw, the first gcd(n +1, n +d +1)=gcd(n +1, d). If we want this to be 1, then d must be coprime with n +1. But then, the next gcd(n +2, d) must also be 1, so d must be coprime with n +2. Continuing this way, d must be coprime with all numbers from n +1 to n +d. But d divides none of these numbers since they are all greater than d (if n ≥1). Wait, but d could be less than n +1. For example, if d=2 and n=2, then n +1=3, which is coprime with d=2. Then n +2=4, which is not coprime with d=2. So gcd(4, 2)=2≠1. Hence, invalid.\\n\\nAlternatively, if d=2 and n=1, then n +1=2 and n +2=3. gcd(2,2)=2≠1, so invalid. So even if n is chosen such that some of the gcds are 1, others will fail.\\n\\nAlternatively, take d=3, n=1: numbers 2,3,4. gcd(2,3)=1, gcd(3,3)=3≠1, gcd(4,3)=1. So fails.\\n\\nn=2, d=3: numbers 3,4,5. gcd(3,3)=3≠1. Fails.\\n\\nn=4, d=3: numbers 5,6,7. gcd(5,3)=1, gcd(6,3)=3≠1, gcd(7,3)=1. Fails.\\n\\nSo no matter how we choose n and d ≥2, there will always be some k where gcd(n +k, d) >1. Hence, only d=1 works. Therefore, the answer is all pairs where m =n +1.\\n\\nHence, the final answer is all pairs of positive integers (m, n) where m =n +1. So, in boxed form, we can represent the solution as all pairs where m =n +1, which is \\\\boxed{(n+1, n)} for all positive integers n. But the problem asks to \"determine all pairs m >n\", so the answer is all pairs where m =n +1, so the boxed answer should reflect that.\\n\\nBut the problem statement might expect us to write the pairs as (m, n) where m =n +1. So in boxed notation, we can write \\\\boxed{(k+1, k)} for each positive integer k. But the standard way to present all solutions is to write \\\\boxed{(m, n) \\\\text{ with } m = n + 1}.\\n\\nAlternatively, since the problem says \"determine all pairs\", and they want the answer in a specific format, likely \\\\boxed{(m, n) \\\\text{ where } m = n + 1}.\\n\\nBut I need to check if the problem expects a specific parametrization or just the general form. Since all such pairs are of the form (n +1, n) for n ≥1, the boxed answer can be written as \\\\boxed{(n+1, n)} for each positive integer n.\\n\\nBut perhaps in the solution, they expect us to say \"all consecutive positive integers where m =n +1\", so \\\\boxed{(m, n) \\\\text{ with } m = n + 1}.\\n\\nAlternatively, since the problem is in Chinese (possibly), the translation might expect a different format. But in most Olympiad problems, when they ask for all pairs, you can write it as (m, n) = (k +1, k) for k ∈ ℕ. But the box should encapsulate the answer. Since there are infinitely many solutions, we can\\'t list them all, so we describe the form.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is that all such pairs are consecutive integers with m =n +1, which is written as \\\\boxed{(m, n) \\\\text{ where } m = n + 1}.\\n\\n**Final Answer**\\nThe pairs are all consecutive positive integers with \\\\( m = n + 1 \\\\).

       "  '<think>\\nOkay, so I need to find all pairs of positive integers m and n where m is greater than n, and the greatest common divisor (gcd) of every pair (n+k, m+k) is 1 for k ranging from 1 to m - n. Hmm, let\\'s parse this problem again to make sure I understand.\\n\\nThe problem states that for all k from 1 up to m - n, the gcd of (n + k, m + k) should be 1. Also, m > n, both positive integers. So, starting from k=1, which gives (n+1, m+1), then k=2 gives (n+2, m+2), and so on until k = m - n, which would be (n + (m - n), m + (m - n)) = (m, 2m - n). All these consecutive pairs must have a gcd of 1.\\n\\nFirst, let me try to understand what the pairs (n + k, m + k) represent. Since k goes from 1 to m - n, the first term in each pair starts at n + 1 and goes up to m, while the second term starts at m + 1 and goes up to 2m - n. So, each pair is (a, b) where a starts from n + 1 and increases by 1 each time, and b starts from m + 1 and also increases by 1 each time. The difference between b and a is (m + k) - (n + k) = m - n, which is constant for all k. So, each pair is two numbers with a fixed difference of m - n, and we need their gcd to be 1.\\n\\nSo, another way to phrase this is: for every integer a from n + 1 to m, the gcd of a and a + (m - n) must be 1. Therefore, the requirement is that every number in the interval [n + 1, m] must be coprime with the number (m - n) positions ahead of it. Since m > n, m - n is a positive integer.\\n\\nLet me denote d = m - n. Then m = n + d. Therefore, the interval [n + 1, m] becomes [n + 1, n + d], which is a sequence of d consecutive integers. The requirement is that for every a in [n + 1, n + d], gcd(a, a + d) = 1. Therefore, each a and a + d must be coprime.\\n\\nSo, restated: For each a in [n + 1, n + d], gcd(a, a + d) = 1. But since a and a + d differ by d, their gcd must divide d. Therefore, gcd(a, d) must be 1 for all a in [n + 1, n + d]. Because if any a and d share a common divisor greater than 1, then gcd(a, a + d) would also be that divisor, which would contradict the requirement of being 1.\\n\\nWait, let me verify this. Suppose gcd(a, a + d) = g. Then g divides both a and a + d, so it divides their difference, which is d. Therefore, g divides d and divides a. So, gcd(a, d) = g. Therefore, gcd(a, a + d) = gcd(a, d). Therefore, the requirement that gcd(a, a + d) = 1 is equivalent to gcd(a, d) = 1. Therefore, all a in [n + 1, n + d] must be coprime with d.\\n\\nTherefore, the problem reduces to: Find positive integers n and d (since d = m - n > 0) such that all integers from n + 1 to n + d are coprime with d. Then m = n + d, so the pairs (m, n) are (n + d, n) where n and d satisfy the above condition.\\n\\nTherefore, the key condition is that the interval [n + 1, n + d] must consist of numbers all coprime with d. So, for all integers a in [n + 1, n + d], gcd(a, d) = 1.\\n\\nSo, my task is to determine all pairs (d, n) such that this holds, then m = n + d. So, first, I need to find d and n where the interval n + 1 to n + d has all numbers coprime to d.\\n\\nThis seems related to the concept of coprime arithmetic progressions or sequences. Let me think.\\n\\nIf all numbers in the interval [n + 1, n + d] are coprime to d, then d must be such that in any block of d consecutive numbers, all are coprime to d. But wait, in any block of d consecutive numbers, exactly one of them is congruent to 0 mod d, so that number would be divisible by d. Therefore, unless d = 1, there is at least one number in the interval [n + 1, n + d] that is divisible by d. But if d > 1, then such a number would have gcd d with d, which is not 1. Therefore, the only way for all numbers in the interval [n + 1, n + d] to be coprime with d is if d = 1. But if d = 1, then m = n + 1, and the interval [n + 1, n + 1] is just n + 1, and gcd(n + 1, m + 1) = gcd(n + 1, n + 2) = 1, which is true because consecutive integers are coprime. So, for d = 1, any n would work, and m = n + 1. But the problem says m > n, so all pairs where m = n + 1 would satisfy the condition. But wait, let\\'s check with d = 1.\\n\\nWait, but in the problem statement, the gcd conditions start from k=1 to k=m - n. If m = n + 1, then m - n = 1, so only k=1 is considered: gcd(n + 1, m + 1) = gcd(n + 1, n + 2) = 1, which is true. Therefore, all consecutive integer pairs (m, n) where m = n + 1 satisfy the condition. However, the problem might have more solutions.\\n\\nBut earlier reasoning suggested that d must be 1, but perhaps I made a mistake there.\\n\\nWait, let\\'s reconsider. Suppose d = 2. Then the interval [n + 1, n + 2] must consist of numbers coprime with 2. That is, both n + 1 and n + 2 must be coprime with 2. However, one of them must be even, so their gcd with 2 would be 2, which is not 1. Therefore, d = 2 is impossible. Similarly, for d = 3: the interval [n + 1, n + 3] must have all numbers coprime with 3. So, n + 1, n + 2, n + 3 must all not be divisible by 3. But in any three consecutive numbers, exactly one is divisible by 3. Therefore, if the interval [n +1, n +3] is three consecutive numbers, one is divisible by 3, which would have gcd 3 with d = 3. Therefore, d = 3 is impossible.\\n\\nSimilarly, for any d > 1, in the interval of d consecutive numbers, there is exactly one number congruent to 0 mod d, which would be divisible by d, hence gcd(a, d) = d > 1. Therefore, unless d = 1, there is no such interval. Therefore, the only possible d is 1, leading to m = n + 1.\\n\\nWait, but let me test with an example. Let’s take d = 1. Then m = n + 1. Then the interval [n +1, n +1] is just {n +1}, and gcd(n +1, n +2) = 1, which is true. So, the pair (m, n) = (n +1, n) works for any n. Therefore, all consecutive integers are solutions.\\n\\nBut is there any other solution? Suppose d = 2. Then m = n + 2. Then the interval [n +1, n +2]. The numbers n +1 and n +2. The gcd(n +1, n +3) and gcd(n +2, n +4). Wait, but according to the problem, the gcds are from k=1 to k=m - n = 2. So, k=1: gcd(n +1, m +1) = gcd(n +1, n +3), and k=2: gcd(n +2, m +2) = gcd(n +2, n +4). Both these gcds must be 1.\\n\\nSo, for d=2, m = n +2. Then we need gcd(n +1, n +3) = 1 and gcd(n +2, n +4) = 1. Since n +1 and n +3 are two apart, their gcd divides 2. Similarly, n +2 and n +4 are two apart, gcd divides 2. So, to have gcd 1, both n +1 and n +3 must be odd, and n +2 and n +4 must be odd. But n +1 and n +3 are two consecutive odd numbers only if n is even. Wait, no. If n is even, then n +1 is odd, n +2 is even, n +3 is odd, n +4 is even. Therefore, if n is even, then n +1 and n +3 are odd (gcd 1), but n +2 and n +4 are even, so gcd(n +2, n +4) = 2, which is not 1. If n is odd, then n +1 is even, n +2 is odd, n +3 is even, n +4 is odd. Then gcd(n +1, n +3) = gcd(even, even) = at least 2, so not 1. Therefore, regardless of n being even or odd, for d=2, we get some gcds greater than 1. Hence, d=2 is impossible. Therefore, d=2 has no solutions.\\n\\nSimilarly, let\\'s check d=3. Then m = n +3. The interval [n +1, n +3]. So, we need gcd(n +1, n +4) = 1, gcd(n +2, n +5) = 1, gcd(n +3, n +6) = 1. Let\\'s check these.\\n\\ngcd(n +1, n +4) = gcd(n +1, 3). So, to have gcd 1, n +1 must not be divisible by 3. Similarly, gcd(n +2, n +5) = gcd(n +2, 3). So, n +2 must not be divisible by 3. gcd(n +3, n +6) = gcd(n +3, 3) = 3, since n +3 is congruent to 0 mod 3. Therefore, this gcd is 3, which violates the condition. Therefore, d=3 is impossible.\\n\\nSo, in this case, even if we choose n such that n +1 and n +2 are not multiples of 3, the last gcd will always be 3. Therefore, d=3 is invalid.\\n\\nSimilarly, for d=4: m = n +4. The interval [n +1, n +4], and we need gcd(n +1, n +5), gcd(n +2, n +6), gcd(n +3, n +7), gcd(n +4, n +8) all equal to 1.\\n\\nBut each of these gcds is gcd(a, a +4). Therefore, each gcd is the same as gcd(a,4). So, unless a is odd and not divisible by 2, but since in four consecutive numbers, two are even. For example, if a is even, then gcd(a,4) is at least 2. Therefore, in the interval [n +1, n +4], there are two even numbers, so their gcd with 4 will be at least 2. Hence, impossible. Therefore, d=4 is invalid.\\n\\nWait, so in general, for d ≥ 2, the interval [n +1, n + d] contains a multiple of d if d ≥ 2. Because in any d consecutive numbers, exactly one is congruent to 0 mod d. But if our interval is [n +1, n + d], then the numbers are n +1, n +2, ..., n + d. If we consider modulo d, these numbers are congruent to (n +1) mod d, (n +2) mod d, ..., (n + d) mod d. The residues are consecutive from (n +1) mod d to (n + d) mod d, which is equivalent to 1, 2, ..., d mod d if n ≡ 0 mod d. Otherwise, they are some shifted sequence. In any case, the residues will cover all residues from 0 to d-1 if the interval includes a multiple of d. Wait, but [n +1, n + d] is d numbers. If n ≡ k mod d, then n +1 ≡ k +1, ..., n + d ≡ k + d ≡ k mod d. Wait, no. If n ≡ k mod d, then n + d ≡ k + d ≡ k mod d. So, the residues would be k +1, k +2, ..., k + d mod d. But since residues cycle modulo d, k + d ≡ k mod d, so the residues would be k +1, k +2, ..., d -1, 0, 1, ..., k mod d. Therefore, if k +1 ≤ d, then the residues go from k +1 to d -1, then wrap around to 0, 1, ..., k. Therefore, in any case, the interval [n +1, n + d] will contain a number congruent to 0 mod d if and only if k +1 ≤ 0 mod d? Wait, maybe not. Let me check.\\n\\nSuppose d = 5 and n ≡ 1 mod 5. Then n +1 ≡ 2 mod 5, n +2 ≡ 3 mod 5, n +3 ≡ 4 mod 5, n +4 ≡ 0 mod 5, n +5 ≡ 1 mod 5. Wait, the interval [n +1, n +5] would be numbers congruent to 2, 3, 4, 0, 1 mod 5. So, yes, it includes 0 mod 5. Therefore, if n ≡ 1 mod 5, then n +4 ≡ 0 mod 5, so gcd(n +4, 5) = 5, which is not 1, violating the condition. Therefore, for any d ≥ 2, in the interval [n +1, n + d], there exists a number congruent to 0 mod d, hence gcd(a, d) = d, which is not 1. Therefore, such a number would have gcd(a, d) > 1, which violates the required condition.\\n\\nTherefore, the only possible value for d is 1. Then, m = n +1, and the interval [n +1, n +1] is just {n +1}, and gcd(n +1, m +1) = gcd(n +1, n +2) = 1, since consecutive integers are coprime. Therefore, this works for any n. Therefore, all pairs where m = n +1 satisfy the condition.\\n\\nBut wait, the problem states \"all pairs m > n of positive integers\" such that the listed gcd conditions hold. Therefore, the conclusion is that the only solutions are pairs where m = n +1.\\n\\nBut let me test this with m = n +1. Then, we need to check that for k = 1 to m -n =1, which is just k=1: gcd(n +1, m +1) = gcd(n +1, n +2). As consecutive integers, their gcd is 1. Therefore, this works. Therefore, all consecutive integers are solutions. Are there any other solutions?\\n\\nSuppose, for example, m = n +2. Then we need to check k=1 and k=2. For k=1: gcd(n +1, m +1) = gcd(n +1, n +3). For k=2: gcd(n +2, m +2) = gcd(n +2, n +4). Let\\'s pick n=1. Then m=3. Check gcd(2,4)=2≠1. So invalid. If n=2, m=4. gcd(3,5)=1, gcd(4,6)=2≠1. Still invalid. If n=3, m=5: gcd(4,6)=2≠1. So, same issue. Therefore, no solutions for d=2.\\n\\nSimilarly, for d=3, m = n +3. Then k=1,2,3. Take n=1, m=4. Check gcd(2,5)=1, gcd(3,6)=3≠1, already fails. n=2, m=5: gcd(3,6)=3≠1. So, no luck. Similarly, n=4, m=7: gcd(5,8)=1, gcd(6,9)=3≠1. So, again, fails. Therefore, indeed, only d=1 works.\\n\\nWait, but maybe there is a non-consecutive pair where the interval [n +1, m] doesn\\'t include a multiple of d? But as we saw earlier, in any d consecutive numbers, there is exactly one multiple of d. Therefore, if the interval is of length d, then there must be a multiple of d in there. Therefore, unless d=1, which only requires the interval to be a single number, which can\\'t be a multiple of 1 except itself, but 1 divides everything. Wait, for d=1, the interval is [n +1, n +1], which is just n +1. Then gcd(n +1, 1) is 1, because gcd(n +1, 1) =1 for any n. Wait, but actually, the original problem says gcd(n +k, m +k). For d=1, m =n +1, so m +k = n +1 +k. When k=1, m +k = n +2. So, gcd(n +1, n +2) =1, which is true. But if we consider d=1, the interval [n +1, n +1] is only one number, but in the problem, the gcds are from k=1 to k=m -n =1, so just one gcd. So, yes, it\\'s okay. But if d=1, m =n +1, then the condition is satisfied.\\n\\nBut in the previous analysis, when we thought about gcd(a, d), for d=1, gcd(a,1)=1 for any a, so trivially satisfied. Therefore, indeed, when d=1, the interval [n +1, n +1] has only one number, which is coprime with 1, so it works. For d >1, we must have a multiple of d in the interval, leading to gcd(a, d) ≥ d >1, which violates the condition. Therefore, only d=1 is possible, meaning m =n +1.\\n\\nTherefore, the solution is all pairs where m =n +1, i.e., consecutive positive integers with m >n.\\n\\nWait, but let me check another case where d=1 but n=1, m=2: Then check gcd(2,3)=1, which is okay. n=2, m=3: gcd(3,4)=1. n=3, m=4: gcd(4,5)=1. All good.\\n\\nIs there any other possible case? Suppose n=1, m=3 (d=2). Then we need to check k=1: gcd(2,4)=2≠1, which fails. Similarly, n=1, m=4 (d=3): check k=1: gcd(2,5)=1, k=2: gcd(3,6)=3≠1, which fails. So, indeed, only d=1 works.\\n\\nTherefore, the answer should be all pairs where m =n +1. So, the solution set is all pairs (m, n) where m =n +1 for some positive integer n. Therefore, the boxed answer is \\\\boxed{(m, n) = (k+1, k) \\\\text{ for some positive integer } k}.\\n\\nWait, but the problem asks to \"Determine all pairs m >n of positive integers\" so the answer is all pairs where m is one more than n, so (n+1, n) for each positive integer n. So, written as ordered pairs (m, n), they are (k+1, k) where k is a positive integer.\\n\\nAlternatively, since the problem says \"put your final answer within \\\\boxed{}\", maybe the answer is that all such pairs are consecutive integers, so \\\\boxed{(m, n) = (k+1, k) \\\\text{ for some positive integer } k}. However, sometimes such answers are written in another way, but I think this is acceptable.\\n\\nWait, but let me check once more. Suppose there exists a pair where m ≠n +1 but still satisfies the conditions. Let\\'s think about d=1: m =n +1. What if d=0? But m >n, so d ≥1. So, no.\\n\\nAlternatively, suppose n=0, but the problem states positive integers, so n ≥1.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe n=1 and m=1, but m must be greater than n.\\n\\nWait, another angle: if d=1, then m =n +1. Then the interval [n +1, m] = [n +1, n +1], so only one number, n +1. Then gcd(n +1, m +1)=gcd(n +1, n +2)=1, which is true. Therefore, correct.\\n\\nTherefore, conclusion: all pairs where m =n +1. Therefore, the answer is all pairs of consecutive positive integers with m =n +1.\\n\\n**Final Answer**\\nThe pairs are all consecutive positive integers, so the solution is \\\\boxed{(m, n) = (k+1, k) \\\\text{ for each positive integer } k}.\\n</think>\\n\\nTo determine all pairs \\\\( m > n \\\\) of positive integers such that\\n\\n\\\\[\\n1 = \\\\gcd(n+1, m+1) = \\\\gcd(n+2, m+2) = \\\\cdots = \\\\gcd(m, 2m - n),\\n\\\\]\\n\\nwe start by noting that for each \\\\( k \\\\) from 1 to \\\\( m - n \\\\), the gcd of \\\\( (n + k, m + k) \\\\) must be 1.

Hmm, that seems a bit complex, but let me break it down step by step.\\n\\nFirst, let\\'s parse the problem statement again. We have pairs (m, n) with m > n, and for each k from 1 up to m - n, the gcd(n + k, m + k) should be 1. Wait, actually, the way it\\'s written is from gcd(n+1, m+1) to gcd(m, 2m - n). Let me check how many terms there are here.\\n\\nStarting with gcd(n+1, m+1): the first term is when we add 1 to both n and m. Then the next is gcd(n+2, m+2), and so on, up to gcd(m, 2m - n). Let me see how many terms this is. The first part is n+1, and the last part is m. So the number of terms is m - (n + 1) + 1 = m - n. Similarly, on the m side, the first term is m+1, and the last term is 2m - n. Let\\'s verify the number of terms here: (2m - n) - (m + 1) + 1 = 2m - n - m - 1 + 1 = m - n. So both sequences have m - n terms. Therefore, we have m - n gcd conditions that must all be equal to 1.\\n\\nSo, we need that for each integer k from 1 to m - n, gcd(n + k, m + k) = 1. Let me try to express m in terms of n and some difference. Let\\'s let d = m - n, since m > n, d is a positive integer. Then m = n + d. Let me substitute m with n + d in the equations. So, the pairs are (n + d, n) where n and d are positive integers, and we need gcd(n + k, n + d + k) = 1 for all k from 1 to d.\\n\\nWait, substituting m = n + d, then for each k from 1 to d, we have gcd(n + k, (n + d) + k) = gcd(n + k, n + k + d) = gcd(n + k, d). Because gcd(a, a + d) = gcd(a, d). Is that right? Let me confirm: gcd(a, a + d) = gcd(a, d). Yes, because any common divisor of a and a + d must divide their difference, which is d. So, indeed, gcd(a, a + d) = gcd(a, d). Therefore, in our case, gcd(n + k, d) = 1 for all k from 1 to d.\\n\\nBut n + k runs from n + 1 to n + d. So, we need that all integers from n + 1 to n + d are coprime with d. Therefore, for each integer x in the interval [n + 1, n + d], gcd(x, d) = 1.\\n\\nSo, this reduces the problem to finding all positive integers n and d such that every number from n + 1 to n + d is coprime with d. Then m = n + d, so our pairs would be (n + d, n).\\n\\nTherefore, the key is to find d and n such that n + 1, n + 2, ..., n + d are all coprime with d. So, what does this mean?\\n\\nIf all numbers from n + 1 to n + d are coprime with d, then none of these numbers can share a common factor with d greater than 1. So, in other words, d must be such that in any block of d consecutive integers, there exists some number divisible by a prime factor of d. Wait, but here we are choosing the block starting at n + 1, so we need that none of these numbers share a prime factor with d.\\n\\nAlternatively, for each prime p dividing d, none of the numbers n + 1, ..., n + d can be divisible by p. Therefore, for each prime p | d, the interval [n + 1, n + d] must not contain any multiple of p. But if d is the length of the interval, and p divides d, then p ≤ d. So, how can an interval of length d not contain a multiple of p? Since p divides d, but p ≤ d. Wait, in an interval of length d, starting at n + 1, if p divides d, then the numbers in the interval would be n + 1, n + 2, ..., n + d. If p divides d, then the spacing between multiples of p is p, so in any d consecutive numbers, since d is a multiple of p, there must be exactly d/p multiples of p. But if d is a multiple of p, then in an interval of d consecutive numbers, there are exactly d/p multiples of p. So unless n is chosen such that the interval [n + 1, n + d] skips all multiples of p. But if p divides d, then in such an interval, since d is a multiple of p, the numbers wrap around modulo p, so there must be a multiple of p in the interval. Wait, that seems conflicting.\\n\\nWait, more carefully: Consider that d is divisible by p. Then in any d consecutive integers, how many multiples of p are there? Exactly d/p, since every p-th number is a multiple. So, for example, if d = p, then there is exactly one multiple of p in any block of p consecutive numbers. Therefore, if we want an interval of length d (which is divisible by p) with no multiples of p, that\\'s impossible. Because in such an interval, you must have exactly d/p multiples, which would be at least 1. Therefore, if d has a prime factor p, then in any interval of d consecutive numbers, there is at least one multiple of p, hence gcd of that number with d would be at least p, which is greater than 1. Therefore, for the gcd(n + k, d) to be 1 for all k from 1 to d, it must be that d has no prime factors. But the only positive integer with no prime factors is 1. Therefore, d must be 1. Wait, that seems too restrictive. Let me check this reasoning again.\\n\\nSuppose d is a prime number, say d = p. Then in any interval of p consecutive numbers, there must be exactly one multiple of p. Hence, in the interval [n + 1, n + p], there is exactly one multiple of p. Therefore, unless that multiple is excluded, but since the interval has length p, we can\\'t avoid it. Therefore, if d is prime, then for any n, the interval [n + 1, n + p] contains exactly one multiple of p, so gcd of that number with p would be p, which is not 1. Hence, to have all gcds equal to 1, d must be 1. Because if d = 1, then the interval is just [n + 1], and gcd(n + 1, 1) is 1, since gcd any number with 1 is 1. Therefore, d = 1 is allowed.\\n\\nBut wait, if d = 1, then m = n + 1, and the only gcd to check is gcd(n + 1, m + 1) = gcd(n + 1, n + 2) = 1, which is always true. So, for any n, m = n + 1 is a solution. But the problem says \"determine all pairs m > n\", so if d = 1, then all pairs where m = n + 1 would work. But according to our earlier reasoning, if d has any prime factor, then in the interval [n + 1, n + d] there must be a multiple of that prime, hence gcd > 1. Therefore, d must be 1. Therefore, the only possible pairs are those with m = n + 1.\\n\\nWait, but let\\'s test with d = 2. Suppose d = 2. Then we need that n + 1 and n + 2 are both coprime with 2. So, gcd(n + 1, 2) = 1 and gcd(n + 2, 2) = 1. But n + 1 and n + 2 are consecutive integers. One of them must be even. Hence, one of the gcds would be 2, which is not 1. Therefore, d = 2 is impossible. Similarly, d = 3. Suppose d = 3. Then we need n + 1, n + 2, n + 3 all coprime with 3. So, in three consecutive numbers, none can be divisible by 3. But in any three consecutive numbers, exactly one is divisible by 3. Hence, impossible. Similarly, for d = 4. The interval [n + 1, n + 4] must have no even numbers? But since it\\'s four consecutive numbers, two of them are even. Hence, gcd with 4 would be at least 2. Therefore, impossible. Therefore, indeed, only d = 1 works. Hence, all pairs where m = n + 1 satisfy the condition.\\n\\nWait, but let me check a specific example. Let\\'s take d = 1. Then m = n + 1. Then we have to check gcd(n + 1, m + 1) = gcd(n + 1, n + 2) = 1, which is true because consecutive numbers are coprime. Since d = 1, there\\'s only one gcd to check. Therefore, this works.\\n\\nBut let\\'s test with d = 1, n = 1: m = 2. Check gcd(2, 3) = 1, which is good. Similarly, n = 2, m = 3: gcd(3, 4) = 1. So that works. So, indeed, all consecutive integer pairs satisfy the condition. But is that the only solution?\\n\\nWait, but let\\'s try d = 1, n = 1, m = 2: works. What if d = 2? Let me see if there\\'s any n where n + 1 and n + 2 are both coprime with 2. But in two consecutive numbers, one is even, so one of them would have gcd 2 with 2, which is not 1. Hence, no solution for d = 2.\\n\\nSimilarly, d = 3: need three consecutive numbers all coprime with 3. But in three consecutive numbers, one is divisible by 3, so that one would have gcd 3 with 3. Hence, no solution for d = 3.\\n\\nSo, in general, for d ≥ 2, since d has at least one prime factor, and in the interval [n + 1, n + d], there must be a multiple of each prime factor of d, hence making the gcd greater than 1. Therefore, only d = 1 works, leading to m = n + 1.\\n\\nTherefore, all pairs where m = n + 1 satisfy the given condition. But let me check if there\\'s another possibility where d is not 1, but maybe composite? Let\\'s take d = 6. Then, the prime factors are 2 and 3. In any interval of 6 consecutive numbers, there must be multiples of 2 and 3. For example, in [n + 1, n + 6], there are 3 even numbers, so gcd with 6 would be 2 or 3 or 6, so definitely not all 1. Hence, d = 6 is invalid.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe if d is a prime power? Let\\'s take d = 4 (which is 2^2). Then, in an interval of 4 numbers, we have two even numbers, so gcd with 4 would be at least 2 for those. So, again, not all 1.\\n\\nTherefore, it seems that only d = 1 works. Therefore, all pairs are m = n + 1. Hence, the solution is all consecutive integers with m = n + 1.\\n\\nWait, but let me check a case where d = 1. For example, n = 1, m = 2: gcd(2, 3) = 1. That works. n = 2, m = 3: gcd(3, 4) = 1. Also works. What about n = 3, m = 4: gcd(4, 5) = 1. Yes. So, all consecutive pairs. But the problem says \"all pairs m > n\", so this would be an infinite set of pairs where m is exactly one more than n.\\n\\nBut the problem says \"determine all pairs\", so the answer is all pairs where m = n + 1. Therefore, the solution is m = n + 1 for any positive integer n.\\n\\nBut wait, let me check the original problem again. The gcds start from gcd(n + 1, m + 1) up to gcd(m, 2m - n). So when m = n + 1, the last gcd is gcd(n + 1, 2(n + 1) - n) = gcd(n + 1, n + 2) = 1. Which is consistent. So, even the last gcd is 1. So, in this case, all the gcds are between consecutive integers, which are always coprime.\\n\\nTherefore, the conclusion is that all pairs where m = n + 1 satisfy the condition. Are there any other pairs?\\n\\nWait, let me test with m = n + 2, n = 1, m = 3. Then we need to check gcd(2, 4) = 2, which is not 1. So that fails. What about m = n + 3, n = 1, m = 4. Check gcd(2, 5) = 1, gcd(3, 6) = 3, which fails. So, only when m = n +1 does this hold.\\n\\nAlternatively, take m = n + 1. Then the sequence of gcds is gcd(n + 1, n + 2), gcd(n + 2, n + 3), ..., gcd(n + (m - n), n + (m - n) + (m - n)). Wait, when m = n +1, the difference d =1, so only one gcd: gcd(n +1, m +1) = gcd(n +1, n + 2) =1, which is correct.\\n\\nTherefore, yes, it seems that the only solutions are pairs where m = n +1.\\n\\nBut wait, let me think again. Suppose n and m are such that m = n +1. Then, the set of gcds required is from gcd(n +1, n + 2) up to gcd(n + (m -n), 2m -n). Since m -n =1, so only one gcd: gcd(n +1, 2(n +1) -n) = gcd(n +1, n +2) =1. So, indeed, it works.\\n\\nBut could there be a case where m -n is greater than1, but all the gcds still equal 1? For example, take m =5, n =2. Then m -n =3. So, the gcds to check are:\\n\\ngcd(3,6)=3, which is not 1. So, fails.\\n\\nAnother example: m =4, n=1. Then gcd(2,5)=1, gcd(3,6)=3≠1. So, fails.\\n\\nWait, how about m =5, n=3. Then d =2. The gcds are gcd(4,6)=2 and gcd(5,7)=1. So, first gcd is 2≠1, so invalid.\\n\\nAlternatively, m = 5, n=4. Then d=1. gcd(5,6)=1. That works.\\n\\nAnother example: m=6, n=5. d=1. gcd(6,7)=1. Works.\\n\\nBut if I take d=2, m =n +2, say n=5, m=7. Then check gcd(6,8)=2≠1, gcd(7,9)=1. So, first gcd fails.\\n\\nAlternatively, n=1, m=3. gcd(2,4)=2≠1. So, invalid.\\n\\nWait, so indeed, whenever d ≥2, the first gcd(n +1, m +1)=gcd(n +1, n + d +1)=gcd(n +1, d). Since m =n +d. Wait, gcd(n +1, n + d +1) = gcd(n +1, (n + d +1) - (n +1)) = gcd(n +1, d). So, to have gcd(n +1, d) =1. Similarly, the next gcd(n +2, m +2) = gcd(n +2, d) =1, and so on up to gcd(n +d, 2m -n) = gcd(n +d, 2(n +d) -n)=gcd(n +d, n +2d)=gcd(n +d, d).\\n\\nWait, so actually, when m =n +d, the problem reduces to gcd(n +k, d) =1 for k=1 to d. So, all numbers from n +1 to n +d must be coprime with d.\\n\\nBut if d has any prime factor p, then in the interval [n +1, n +d], there must be a multiple of p. However, if n is congruent to -k mod p for some k in 1 to d, then n +k ≡0 mod p. Therefore, unless n ≡ -1, -2, ..., -d mod p, which is equivalent to n ≡ p -1, p -2, ..., p -d mod p. But if d ≥p, then p -d ≤0, so n would have to be in a certain residue class mod p. Wait, this might not be possible for all primes p dividing d.\\n\\nAlternatively, for each prime p dividing d, the numbers n +1, ..., n +d must not be divisible by p. But in an interval of d consecutive numbers, if p divides d, then since p ≤d, there must be a multiple of p in that interval. Therefore, if p divides d, then such an interval cannot avoid having a multiple of p, hence gcd(n +k, d) ≥p >1 for some k. Therefore, d must not have any prime factors, i.e., d=1. Therefore, the only solution is d=1, leading to m =n +1.\\n\\nTherefore, the conclusion is that all pairs where m =n +1 are the only solutions. Therefore, the answer is all pairs of consecutive positive integers where m =n +1.\\n\\nBut let me confirm with another approach. Suppose m =n +1. Then the conditions require gcd(n +1, n +2)=1, which is true. Also, the last gcd is gcd(m, 2m -n)=gcd(n +1, 2(n +1) -n)=gcd(n +1, n +2)=1. Since m -n =1, there\\'s only one gcd to check. So that works.\\n\\nIf m =n +d where d ≥2, then as we saw, the first gcd(n +1, n +d +1)=gcd(n +1, d). If we want this to be 1, then d must be coprime with n +1. But then, the next gcd(n +2, d) must also be 1, so d must be coprime with n +2. Continuing this way, d must be coprime with all numbers from n +1 to n +d. But d divides none of these numbers since they are all greater than d (if n ≥1). Wait, but d could be less than n +1. For example, if d=2 and n=2, then n +1=3, which is coprime with d=2. Then n +2=4, which is not coprime with d=2. So gcd(4, 2)=2≠1. Hence, invalid.\\n\\nAlternatively, if d=2 and n=1, then n +1=2 and n +2=3. gcd(2,2)=2≠1, so invalid. So even if n is chosen such that some of the gcds are 1, others will fail.\\n\\nAlternatively, take d=3, n=1: numbers 2,3,4. gcd(2,3)=1, gcd(3,3)=3≠1, gcd(4,3)=1. So fails.\\n\\nn=2, d=3: numbers 3,4,5. gcd(3,3)=3≠1. Fails.\\n\\nn=4, d=3: numbers 5,6,7. gcd(5,3)=1, gcd(6,3)=3≠1, gcd(7,3)=1. Fails.\\n\\nSo no matter how we choose n and d ≥2, there will always be some k where gcd(n +k, d) >1. Hence, only d=1 works. Therefore, the answer is all pairs where m =n +1.\\n\\nHence, the final answer is all pairs of positive integers (m, n) where m =n +1. So, in boxed form, we can represent the solution as all pairs where m =n +1, which is \\\\boxed{(n+1, n)} for all positive integers n. But the problem asks to \"determine all pairs m >n\", so the answer is all pairs where m =n +1, so the boxed answer should reflect that.\\n\\nBut the problem statement might expect us to write the pairs as (m, n) where m =n +1. So in boxed notation, we can write \\\\boxed{(k+1, k)} for each positive integer k. But the standard way to present all solutions is to write \\\\boxed{(m, n) \\\\text{ with } m = n + 1}.\\n\\nAlternatively, since the problem says \"determine all pairs\", and they want the answer in a specific format, likely \\\\boxed{(m, n) \\\\text{ where } m = n + 1}.\\n\\nBut I need to check if the problem expects a specific parametrization or just the general form. Since all such pairs are of the form (n +1, n) for n ≥1, the boxed answer can be written as \\\\boxed{(n+1, n)} for each positive integer n.\\n\\nBut perhaps in the solution, they expect us to say \"all consecutive positive integers where m =n +1\", so \\\\boxed{(m, n) \\\\text{ with } m = n + 1}.\\n\\nAlternatively, since the problem is in Chinese (possibly), the translation might expect a different format. But in most Olympiad problems, when they ask for all pairs, you can write it as (m, n) = (k +1, k) for k ∈ ℕ. But the box should encapsulate the answer. Since there are infinitely many solutions, we can\\'t list them all, so we describe the form.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is that all such pairs are consecutive integers with m =n +1, which is written as \\\\boxed{(m, n) \\\\text{ where } m = n + 1}.\\n\\n**Final Answer**\\nThe pairs are all consecutive positive integers with \\\\( m = n + 1 \\\\). Thus, the solution is \\\\boxed{(m, n) \\\\text{ where } m = n + 1}.\\n</think>\\n\\nTo determine all pairs \\\\( m > n \\\\) of positive integers such that\\n\\n$$\\n1 = \\\\gcd(n+1, m+1) = \\\\gcd(n+2, m+2) = \\\\cdots = \\\\gcd(m, 2m-n),\\n$$\\n\\nwe start by letting \\\\( d = m - n \\\\). This transforms the problem into finding pairs \\\\( (n + d, n) \\\\) such that \\\\(\\\\gcd(n + k, d) = 1\\\\) for all \\\\( k \\\\) from 1 to \\\\( d \\\\).

Hmm, that seems a bit complex, but let me break it down step by step.\\n\\nFirst, let\\'s parse the problem statement again. We have pairs (m, n) with m > n, and for each k from 1 up to m - n, the gcd(n + k, m + k) should be 1. Wait, actually, the way it\\'s written is from gcd(n+1, m+1) to gcd(m, 2m - n). Let me check how many terms there are here.\\n\\nStarting with gcd(n+1, m+1): the first term is when we add 1 to both n and m. Then the next is gcd(n+2, m+2), and so on, up to gcd(m, 2m - n). Let me see how many terms this is. The first part is n+1, and the last part is m. So the number of terms is m - (n + 1) + 1 = m - n. Similarly, on the m side, the first term is m+1, and the last term is 2m - n. Let\\'s verify the number of terms here: (2m - n) - (m + 1) + 1 = 2m - n - m - 1 + 1 = m - n. So both sequences have m - n terms. Therefore, we have m - n gcd conditions that must all be equal to 1.\\n\\nSo, we need that for each integer k from 1 to m - n, gcd(n + k, m + k) = 1. Let me try to express m in terms of n and some difference. Let\\'s let d = m - n, since m > n, d is a positive integer. Then m = n + d. Let me substitute m with n + d in the equations. So, the pairs are (n + d, n) where n and d are positive integers, and we need gcd(n + k, n + d + k) = 1 for all k from 1 to d.\\n\\nWait, substituting m = n + d, then for each k from 1 to d, we have gcd(n + k, (n + d) + k) = gcd(n + k, n + k + d) = gcd(n + k, d). Because gcd(a, a + d) = gcd(a, d). Is that right? Let me confirm: gcd(a, a + d) = gcd(a, d). Yes, because any common divisor of a and a + d must divide their difference, which is d. So, indeed, gcd(a, a + d) = gcd(a, d). Therefore, in our case, gcd(n + k, d) = 1 for all k from 1 to d.\\n\\nBut n + k runs from n + 1 to n + d. So, we need that all integers from n + 1 to n + d are coprime with d. Therefore, for each integer x in the interval [n + 1, n + d], gcd(x, d) = 1.\\n\\nSo, this reduces the problem to finding all positive integers n and d such that every number from n + 1 to n + d is coprime with d. Then m = n + d, so our pairs would be (n + d, n).\\n\\nTherefore, the key is to find d and n such that n + 1, n + 2, ..., n + d are all coprime with d. So, what does this mean?\\n\\nIf all numbers from n + 1 to n + d are coprime with d, then none of these numbers can share a common factor with d greater than 1. So, in other words, d must be such that in any block of d consecutive integers, there exists some number divisible by a prime factor of d. Wait, but here we are choosing the block starting at n + 1, so we need that none of these numbers share a prime factor with d.\\n\\nAlternatively, for each prime p dividing d, none of the numbers n + 1, ..., n + d can be divisible by p. Therefore, for each prime p | d, the interval [n + 1, n + d] must not contain any multiple of p. But if d is the length of the interval, and p divides d, then p ≤ d. So, how can an interval of length d not contain a multiple of p? Since p divides d, but p ≤ d. Wait, in an interval of length d, starting at n + 1, if p divides d, then the numbers in the interval would be n + 1, n + 2, ..., n + d. If p divides d, then the spacing between multiples of p is p, so in any d consecutive numbers, since d is a multiple of p, there must be exactly d/p multiples of p. But if d is a multiple of p, then in an interval of d consecutive numbers, there are exactly d/p multiples of p. So unless n is chosen such that the interval [n + 1, n + d] skips all multiples of p. But if p divides d, then in such an interval, since d is a multiple of p, the numbers wrap around modulo p, so there must be a multiple of p in the interval. Wait, that seems conflicting.\\n\\nWait, more carefully: Consider that d is divisible by p. Then in any d consecutive integers, how many multiples of p are there? Exactly d/p, since every p-th number is a multiple. So, for example, if d = p, then there is exactly one multiple of p in any block of p consecutive numbers. Therefore, if we want an interval of length d (which is divisible by p) with no multiples of p, that\\'s impossible. Because in such an interval, you must have exactly d/p multiples, which would be at least 1. Therefore, if d has a prime factor p, then in any interval of d consecutive numbers, there is at least one multiple of p, hence gcd of that number with d would be at least p, which is greater than 1. Therefore, for the gcd(n + k, d) to be 1 for all k from 1 to d, it must be that d has no prime factors. But the only positive integer with no prime factors is 1. Therefore, d must be 1. Wait, that seems too restrictive. Let me check this reasoning again.\\n\\nSuppose d is a prime number, say d = p. Then in any interval of p consecutive numbers, there must be exactly one multiple of p. Hence, in the interval [n + 1, n + p], there is exactly one multiple of p. Therefore, unless that multiple is excluded, but since the interval has length p, we can\\'t avoid it. Therefore, if d is prime, then for any n, the interval [n + 1, n + p] contains exactly one multiple of p, so gcd of that number with p would be p, which is not 1. Hence, to have all gcds equal to 1, d must be 1. Because if d = 1, then the interval is just [n + 1], and gcd(n + 1, 1) is 1, since gcd any number with 1 is 1. Therefore, d = 1 is allowed.\\n\\nBut wait, if d = 1, then m = n + 1, and the only gcd to check is gcd(n + 1, m + 1) = gcd(n + 1, n + 2) = 1, which is always true. So, for any n, m = n + 1 is a solution. But the problem says \"determine all pairs m > n\", so if d = 1, then all pairs where m = n + 1 would work. But according to our earlier reasoning, if d has any prime factor, then in the interval [n + 1, n + d] there must be a multiple of that prime, hence gcd > 1. Therefore, d must be 1. Therefore, the only possible pairs are those with m = n + 1.\\n\\nWait, but let\\'s test with d = 2. Suppose d = 2. Then we need that n + 1 and n + 2 are both coprime with 2. So, gcd(n + 1, 2) = 1 and gcd(n + 2, 2) = 1. But n + 1 and n + 2 are consecutive integers. One of them must be even. Hence, one of the gcds would be 2, which is not 1. Therefore, d = 2 is impossible. Similarly, d = 3. Suppose d = 3. Then we need n + 1, n + 2, n + 3 all coprime with 3. So, in three consecutive numbers, none can be divisible by 3. But in any three consecutive numbers, exactly one is divisible by 3. Hence, impossible. Similarly, for d = 4. The interval [n + 1, n + 4] must have no even numbers? But since it\\'s four consecutive numbers, two of them are even. Hence, gcd with 4 would be at least 2. Therefore, impossible. Therefore, indeed, only d = 1 works. Hence, all pairs where m = n + 1 satisfy the condition.\\n\\nWait, but let me check a specific example. Let\\'s take d = 1. Then m = n + 1. Then we have to check gcd(n + 1, m + 1) = gcd(n + 1, n + 2) = 1, which is true because consecutive numbers are coprime. Since d = 1, there\\'s only one gcd to check. Therefore, this works.\\n\\nBut let\\'s test with d = 1, n = 1: m = 2. Check gcd(2, 3) = 1, which is good. Similarly, n = 2, m = 3: gcd(3, 4) = 1. So that works. So, indeed, all consecutive integer pairs satisfy the condition. But is that the only solution?\\n\\nWait, but let\\'s try d = 1, n = 1, m = 2: works. What if d = 2? Let me see if there\\'s any n where n + 1 and n + 2 are both coprime with 2. But in two consecutive numbers, one is even, so one of them would have gcd 2 with 2, which is not 1. Hence, no solution for d = 2.\\n\\nSimilarly, d = 3: need three consecutive numbers all coprime with 3. But in three consecutive numbers, one is divisible by 3, so that one would have gcd 3 with 3. Hence, no solution for d = 3.\\n\\nSo, in general, for d ≥ 2, since d has at least one prime factor, and in the interval [n + 1, n + d], there must be a multiple of each prime factor of d, hence making the gcd greater than 1. Therefore, only d = 1 works, leading to m = n + 1.\\n\\nTherefore, all pairs where m = n + 1 satisfy the given condition. But let me check if there\\'s another possibility where d is not 1, but maybe composite? Let\\'s take d = 6. Then, the prime factors are 2 and 3. In any interval of 6 consecutive numbers, there must be multiples of 2 and 3. For example, in [n + 1, n + 6], there are 3 even numbers, so gcd with 6 would be 2 or 3 or 6, so definitely not all 1. Hence, d = 6 is invalid.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe if d is a prime power? Let\\'s take d = 4 (which is 2^2). Then, in an interval of 4 numbers, we have two even numbers, so gcd with 4 would be at least 2 for those. So, again, not all 1.\\n\\nTherefore, it seems that only d = 1 works. Therefore, all pairs are m = n + 1. Hence, the solution is all consecutive integers with m = n + 1.\\n\\nWait, but let me check a case where d = 1. For example, n = 1, m = 2: gcd(2, 3) = 1. That works. n = 2, m = 3: gcd(3, 4) = 1. Also works. What about n = 3, m = 4: gcd(4, 5) = 1. Yes. So, all consecutive pairs. But the problem says \"all pairs m > n\", so this would be an infinite set of pairs where m is exactly one more than n.\\n\\nBut the problem says \"determine all pairs\", so the answer is all pairs where m = n + 1. Therefore, the solution is m = n + 1 for any positive integer n.\\n\\nBut wait, let me check the original problem again. The gcds start from gcd(n + 1, m + 1) up to gcd(m, 2m - n). So when m = n + 1, the last gcd is gcd(n + 1, 2(n + 1) - n) = gcd(n + 1, n + 2) = 1. Which is consistent. So, even the last gcd is 1. So, in this case, all the gcds are between consecutive integers, which are always coprime.\\n\\nTherefore, the conclusion is that all pairs where m = n + 1 satisfy the condition. Are there any other pairs?\\n\\nWait, let me test with m = n + 2, n = 1, m = 3. Then we need to check gcd(2, 4) = 2, which is not 1. So that fails. What about m = n + 3, n = 1, m = 4. Check gcd(2, 5) = 1, gcd(3, 6) = 3, which fails. So, only when m = n +1 does this hold.\\n\\nAlternatively, take m = n + 1. Then the sequence of gcds is gcd(n + 1, n + 2), gcd(n + 2, n + 3), ..., gcd(n + (m - n), n + (m - n) + (m - n)). Wait, when m = n +1, the difference d =1, so only one gcd: gcd(n +1, m +1) = gcd(n +1, n + 2) =1, which is correct.\\n\\nTherefore, yes, it seems that the only solutions are pairs where m = n +1.\\n\\nBut wait, let me think again. Suppose n and m are such that m = n +1. Then, the set of gcds required is from gcd(n +1, n + 2) up to gcd(n + (m -n), 2m -n). Since m -n =1, so only one gcd: gcd(n +1, 2(n +1) -n) = gcd(n +1, n +2) =1. So, indeed, it works.\\n\\nBut could there be a case where m -n is greater than1, but all the gcds still equal 1? For example, take m =5, n =2. Then m -n =3. So, the gcds to check are:\\n\\ngcd(3,6)=3, which is not 1. So, fails.\\n\\nAnother example: m =4, n=1. Then gcd(2,5)=1, gcd(3,6)=3≠1. So, fails.\\n\\nWait, how about m =5, n=3. Then d =2. The gcds are gcd(4,6)=2 and gcd(5,7)=1. So, first gcd is 2≠1, so invalid.\\n\\nAlternatively, m = 5, n=4. Then d=1. gcd(5,6)=1. That works.\\n\\nAnother example: m=6, n=5. d=1. gcd(6,7)=1. Works.\\n\\nBut if I take d=2, m =n +2, say n=5, m=7. Then check gcd(6,8)=2≠1, gcd(7,9)=1. So, first gcd fails.\\n\\nAlternatively, n=1, m=3. gcd(2,4)=2≠1. So, invalid.\\n\\nWait, so indeed, whenever d ≥2, the first gcd(n +1, m +1)=gcd(n +1, n + d +1)=gcd(n +1, d). Since m =n +d. Wait, gcd(n +1, n + d +1) = gcd(n +1, (n + d +1) - (n +1)) = gcd(n +1, d). So, to have gcd(n +1, d) =1. Similarly, the next gcd(n +2, m +2) = gcd(n +2, d) =1, and so on up to gcd(n +d, 2m -n) = gcd(n +d, 2(n +d) -n)=gcd(n +d, n +2d)=gcd(n +d, d).\\n\\nWait, so actually, when m =n +d, the problem reduces to gcd(n +k, d) =1 for k=1 to d. So, all numbers from n +1 to n +d must be coprime with d.\\n\\nBut if d has any prime factor p, then in the interval [n +1, n +d], there must be a multiple of p. However, if n is congruent to -k mod p for some k in 1 to d, then n +k ≡0 mod p. Therefore, unless n ≡ -1, -2, ..., -d mod p, which is equivalent to n ≡ p -1, p -2, ..., p -d mod p. But if d ≥p, then p -d ≤0, so n would have to be in a certain residue class mod p. Wait, this might not be possible for all primes p dividing d.\\n\\nAlternatively, for each prime p dividing d, the numbers n +1, ..., n +d must not be divisible by p. But in an interval of d consecutive numbers, if p divides d, then since p ≤d, there must be a multiple of p in that interval. Therefore, if p divides d, then such an interval cannot avoid having a multiple of p, hence gcd(n +k, d) ≥p >1 for some k. Therefore, d must not have any prime factors, i.e., d=1. Therefore, the only solution is d=1, leading to m =n +1.\\n\\nTherefore, the conclusion is that all pairs where m =n +1 are the only solutions. Therefore, the answer is all pairs of consecutive positive integers where m =n +1.\\n\\nBut let me confirm with another approach. Suppose m =n +1. Then the conditions require gcd(n +1, n +2)=1, which is true. Also, the last gcd is gcd(m, 2m -n)=gcd(n +1, 2(n +1) -n)=gcd(n +1, n +2)=1. Since m -n =1, there\\'s only one gcd to check. So that works.\\n\\nIf m =n +d where d ≥2, then as we saw, the first gcd(n +1, n +d +1)=gcd(n +1, d). If we want this to be 1, then d must be coprime with n +1. But then, the next gcd(n +2, d) must also be 1, so d must be coprime with n +2. Continuing this way, d must be coprime with all numbers from n +1 to n +d. But d divides none of these numbers since they are all greater than d (if n ≥1). Wait, but d could be less than n +1. For example, if d=2 and n=2, then n +1=3, which is coprime with d=2. Then n +2=4, which is not coprime with d=2. So gcd(4, 2)=2≠1. Hence, invalid.\\n\\nAlternatively, if d=2 and n=1, then n +1=2 and n +2=3. gcd(2,2)=2≠1, so invalid. So even if n is chosen such that some of the gcds are 1, others will fail.\\n\\nAlternatively, take d=3, n=1: numbers 2,3,4. gcd(2,3)=1, gcd(3,3)=3≠1, gcd(4,3)=1. So fails.\\n\\nn=2, d=3: numbers 3,4,5. gcd(3,3)=3≠1. Fails.\\n\\nn=4, d=3: numbers 5,6,7. gcd(5,3)=1, gcd(6,3)=3≠1, gcd(7,3)=1. Fails.\\n\\nSo no matter how we choose n and d ≥2, there will always be some k where gcd(n +k, d) >1. Hence, only d=1 works. Therefore, the answer is all pairs where m =n +1.\\n\\nHence, the final answer is all pairs of positive integers (m, n) where m =n +1. So, in boxed form, we can represent the solution as all pairs where m =n +1, which is \\\\boxed{(n+1, n)} for all positive integers n. But the problem asks to \"determine all pairs m >n\", so the answer is all pairs where m =n +1, so the boxed answer should reflect that.\\n\\nBut the problem statement might expect us to write the pairs as (m, n) where m =n +1. So in boxed notation, we can write \\\\boxed{(k+1, k)} for each positive integer k. But the standard way to present all solutions is to write \\\\boxed{(m, n) \\\\text{ with } m = n + 1}.\\n\\nAlternatively, since the problem says \"determine all pairs\", and they want the answer in a specific format, likely \\\\boxed{(m, n) \\\\text{ where } m = n + 1}.\\n\\nBut I need to check if the problem expects a specific parametrization or just the general form. Since all such pairs are of the form (n +1, n) for n ≥1, the boxed answer can be written as \\\\boxed{(n+1, n)} for each positive integer n.\\n\\nBut perhaps in the solution, they expect us to say \"all consecutive positive integers where m =n +1\", so \\\\boxed{(m, n) \\\\text{ with } m = n + 1}.\\n\\nAlternatively, since the problem is in Chinese (possibly), the translation might expect a different format. But in most Olympiad problems, when they ask for all pairs, you can write it as (m, n) = (k +1, k) for k ∈ ℕ. But the box should encapsulate the answer. Since there are infinitely many solutions, we can\\'t list them all, so we describe the form.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is that all such pairs are consecutive integers with m =n +1, which is written as \\\\boxed{(m, n) \\\\text{ where } m = n + 1}.\\n\\n**Final Answer**\\nThe pairs are all consecutive positive integers with \\\\( m = n + 1 \\\\).

Hmm, that seems a bit complex, but let me break it down step by step.\\n\\nFirst, let\\'s parse the problem statement again. We have pairs (m, n) with m > n, and for each k from 1 up to m - n, the gcd(n + k, m + k) should be 1. Wait, actually, the way it\\'s written is from gcd(n+1, m+1) to gcd(m, 2m - n). Let me check how many terms there are here.\\n\\nStarting with gcd(n+1, m+1): the first term is when we add 1 to both n and m. Then the next is gcd(n+2, m+2), and so on, up to gcd(m, 2m - n). Let me see how many terms this is. The first part is n+1, and the last part is m. So the number of terms is m - (n + 1) + 1 = m - n. Similarly, on the m side, the first term is m+1, and the last term is 2m - n. Let\\'s verify the number of terms here: (2m - n) - (m + 1) + 1 = 2m - n - m - 1 + 1 = m - n. So both sequences have m - n terms. Therefore, we have m - n gcd conditions that must all be equal to 1.\\n\\nSo, we need that for each integer k from 1 to m - n, gcd(n + k, m + k) = 1. Let me try to express m in terms of n and some difference. Let\\'s let d = m - n, since m > n, d is a positive integer. Then m = n + d. Let me substitute m with n + d in the equations. So, the pairs are (n + d, n) where n and d are positive integers, and we need gcd(n + k, n + d + k) = 1 for all k from 1 to d.\\n\\nWait, substituting m = n + d, then for each k from 1 to d, we have gcd(n + k, (n + d) + k) = gcd(n + k, n + k + d) = gcd(n + k, d). Because gcd(a, a + d) = gcd(a, d). Is that right? Let me confirm: gcd(a, a + d) = gcd(a, d). Yes, because any common divisor of a and a + d must divide their difference, which is d. So, indeed, gcd(a, a + d) = gcd(a, d). Therefore, in our case, gcd(n + k, d) = 1 for all k from 1 to d.\\n\\nBut n + k runs from n + 1 to n + d. So, we need that all integers from n + 1 to n + d are coprime with d. Therefore, for each integer x in the interval [n + 1, n + d], gcd(x, d) = 1.\\n\\nSo, this reduces the problem to finding all positive integers n and d such that every number from n + 1 to n + d is coprime with d. Then m = n + d, so our pairs would be (n + d, n).\\n\\nTherefore, the key is to find d and n such that n + 1, n + 2, ..., n + d are all coprime with d. So, what does this mean?\\n\\nIf all numbers from n + 1 to n + d are coprime with d, then none of these numbers can share a common factor with d greater than 1. So, in other words, d must be such that in any block of d consecutive integers, there exists some number divisible by a prime factor of d. Wait, but here we are choosing the block starting at n + 1, so we need that none of these numbers share a prime factor with d.\\n\\nAlternatively, for each prime p dividing d, none of the numbers n + 1, ..., n + d can be divisible by p. Therefore, for each prime p | d, the interval [n + 1, n + d] must not contain any multiple of p. But if d is the length of the interval, and p divides d, then p ≤ d. So, how can an interval of length d not contain a multiple of p? Since p divides d, but p ≤ d. Wait, in an interval of length d, starting at n + 1, if p divides d, then the numbers in the interval would be n + 1, n + 2, ..., n + d. If p divides d, then the spacing between multiples of p is p, so in any d consecutive numbers, since d is a multiple of p, there must be exactly d/p multiples of p. But if d is a multiple of p, then in an interval of d consecutive numbers, there are exactly d/p multiples of p. So unless n is chosen such that the interval [n + 1, n + d] skips all multiples of p. But if p divides d, then in such an interval, since d is a multiple of p, the numbers wrap around modulo p, so there must be a multiple of p in the interval. Wait, that seems conflicting.\\n\\nWait, more carefully: Consider that d is divisible by p. Then in any d consecutive integers, how many multiples of p are there? Exactly d/p, since every p-th number is a multiple. So, for example, if d = p, then there is exactly one multiple of p in any block of p consecutive numbers. Therefore, if we want an interval of length d (which is divisible by p) with no multiples of p, that\\'s impossible. Because in such an interval, you must have exactly d/p multiples, which would be at least 1. Therefore, if d has a prime factor p, then in any interval of d consecutive numbers, there is at least one multiple of p, hence gcd of that number with d would be at least p, which is greater than 1. Therefore, for the gcd(n + k, d) to be 1 for all k from 1 to d, it must be that d has no prime factors. But the only positive integer with no prime factors is 1. Therefore, d must be 1. Wait, that seems too restrictive. Let me check this reasoning again.\\n\\nSuppose d is a prime number, say d = p. Then in any interval of p consecutive numbers, there must be exactly one multiple of p. Hence, in the interval [n + 1, n + p], there is exactly one multiple of p. Therefore, unless that multiple is excluded, but since the interval has length p, we can\\'t avoid it. Therefore, if d is prime, then for any n, the interval [n + 1, n + p] contains exactly one multiple of p, so gcd of that number with p would be p, which is not 1. Hence, to have all gcds equal to 1, d must be 1. Because if d = 1, then the interval is just [n + 1], and gcd(n + 1, 1) is 1, since gcd any number with 1 is 1. Therefore, d = 1 is allowed.\\n\\nBut wait, if d = 1, then m = n + 1, and the only gcd to check is gcd(n + 1, m + 1) = gcd(n + 1, n + 2) = 1, which is always true. So, for any n, m = n + 1 is a solution. But the problem says \"determine all pairs m > n\", so if d = 1, then all pairs where m = n + 1 would work. But according to our earlier reasoning, if d has any prime factor, then in the interval [n + 1, n + d] there must be a multiple of that prime, hence gcd > 1. Therefore, d must be 1. Therefore, the only possible pairs are those with m = n + 1.\\n\\nWait, but let\\'s test with d = 2. Suppose d = 2. Then we need that n + 1 and n + 2 are both coprime with 2. So, gcd(n + 1, 2) = 1 and gcd(n + 2, 2) = 1. But n + 1 and n + 2 are consecutive integers. One of them must be even. Hence, one of the gcds would be 2, which is not 1. Therefore, d = 2 is impossible. Similarly, d = 3. Suppose d = 3. Then we need n + 1, n + 2, n + 3 all coprime with 3. So, in three consecutive numbers, none can be divisible by 3. But in any three consecutive numbers, exactly one is divisible by 3. Hence, impossible. Similarly, for d = 4. The interval [n + 1, n + 4] must have no even numbers? But since it\\'s four consecutive numbers, two of them are even. Hence, gcd with 4 would be at least 2. Therefore, impossible. Therefore, indeed, only d = 1 works. Hence, all pairs where m = n + 1 satisfy the condition.\\n\\nWait, but let me check a specific example. Let\\'s take d = 1. Then m = n + 1. Then we have to check gcd(n + 1, m + 1) = gcd(n + 1, n + 2) = 1, which is true because consecutive numbers are coprime. Since d = 1, there\\'s only one gcd to check. Therefore, this works.\\n\\nBut let\\'s test with d = 1, n = 1: m = 2. Check gcd(2, 3) = 1, which is good. Similarly, n = 2, m = 3: gcd(3, 4) = 1. So that works. So, indeed, all consecutive integer pairs satisfy the condition. But is that the only solution?\\n\\nWait, but let\\'s try d = 1, n = 1, m = 2: works. What if d = 2? Let me see if there\\'s any n where n + 1 and n + 2 are both coprime with 2. But in two consecutive numbers, one is even, so one of them would have gcd 2 with 2, which is not 1. Hence, no solution for d = 2.\\n\\nSimilarly, d = 3: need three consecutive numbers all coprime with 3. But in three consecutive numbers, one is divisible by 3, so that one would have gcd 3 with 3. Hence, no solution for d = 3.\\n\\nSo, in general, for d ≥ 2, since d has at least one prime factor, and in the interval [n + 1, n + d], there must be a multiple of each prime factor of d, hence making the gcd greater than 1. Therefore, only d = 1 works, leading to m = n + 1.\\n\\nTherefore, all pairs where m = n + 1 satisfy the given condition. But let me check if there\\'s another possibility where d is not 1, but maybe composite? Let\\'s take d = 6. Then, the prime factors are 2 and 3. In any interval of 6 consecutive numbers, there must be multiples of 2 and 3. For example, in [n + 1, n + 6], there are 3 even numbers, so gcd with 6 would be 2 or 3 or 6, so definitely not all 1. Hence, d = 6 is invalid.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe if d is a prime power? Let\\'s take d = 4 (which is 2^2). Then, in an interval of 4 numbers, we have two even numbers, so gcd with 4 would be at least 2 for those. So, again, not all 1.\\n\\nTherefore, it seems that only d = 1 works. Therefore, all pairs are m = n + 1. Hence, the solution is all consecutive integers with m = n + 1.\\n\\nWait, but let me check a case where d = 1. For example, n = 1, m = 2: gcd(2, 3) = 1. That works. n = 2, m = 3: gcd(3, 4) = 1. Also works. What about n = 3, m = 4: gcd(4, 5) = 1. Yes. So, all consecutive pairs. But the problem says \"all pairs m > n\", so this would be an infinite set of pairs where m is exactly one more than n.\\n\\nBut the problem says \"determine all pairs\", so the answer is all pairs where m = n + 1. Therefore, the solution is m = n + 1 for any positive integer n.\\n\\nBut wait, let me check the original problem again. The gcds start from gcd(n + 1, m + 1) up to gcd(m, 2m - n). So when m = n + 1, the last gcd is gcd(n + 1, 2(n + 1) - n) = gcd(n + 1, n + 2) = 1. Which is consistent. So, even the last gcd is 1. So, in this case, all the gcds are between consecutive integers, which are always coprime.\\n\\nTherefore, the conclusion is that all pairs where m = n + 1 satisfy the condition. Are there any other pairs?\\n\\nWait, let me test with m = n + 2, n = 1, m = 3. Then we need to check gcd(2, 4) = 2, which is not 1. So that fails. What about m = n + 3, n = 1, m = 4. Check gcd(2, 5) = 1, gcd(3, 6) = 3, which fails. So, only when m = n +1 does this hold.\\n\\nAlternatively, take m = n + 1. Then the sequence of gcds is gcd(n + 1, n + 2), gcd(n + 2, n + 3), ..., gcd(n + (m - n), n + (m - n) + (m - n)). Wait, when m = n +1, the difference d =1, so only one gcd: gcd(n +1, m +1) = gcd(n +1, n + 2) =1, which is correct.\\n\\nTherefore, yes, it seems that the only solutions are pairs where m = n +1.\\n\\nBut wait, let me think again. Suppose n and m are such that m = n +1. Then, the set of gcds required is from gcd(n +1, n + 2) up to gcd(n + (m -n), 2m -n). Since m -n =1, so only one gcd: gcd(n +1, 2(n +1) -n) = gcd(n +1, n +2) =1. So, indeed, it works.\\n\\nBut could there be a case where m -n is greater than1, but all the gcds still equal 1? For example, take m =5, n =2. Then m -n =3. So, the gcds to check are:\\n\\ngcd(3,6)=3, which is not 1. So, fails.\\n\\nAnother example: m =4, n=1. Then gcd(2,5)=1, gcd(3,6)=3≠1. So, fails.\\n\\nWait, how about m =5, n=3. Then d =2. The gcds are gcd(4,6)=2 and gcd(5,7)=1. So, first gcd is 2≠1, so invalid.\\n\\nAlternatively, m = 5, n=4. Then d=1. gcd(5,6)=1. That works.\\n\\nAnother example: m=6, n=5. d=1. gcd(6,7)=1. Works.\\n\\nBut if I take d=2, m =n +2, say n=5, m=7. Then check gcd(6,8)=2≠1, gcd(7,9)=1. So, first gcd fails.\\n\\nAlternatively, n=1, m=3. gcd(2,4)=2≠1. So, invalid.\\n\\nWait, so indeed, whenever d ≥2, the first gcd(n +1, m +1)=gcd(n +1, n + d +1)=gcd(n +1, d). Since m =n +d. Wait, gcd(n +1, n + d +1) = gcd(n +1, (n + d +1) - (n +1)) = gcd(n +1, d). So, to have gcd(n +1, d) =1. Similarly, the next gcd(n +2, m +2) = gcd(n +2, d) =1, and so on up to gcd(n +d, 2m -n) = gcd(n +d, 2(n +d) -n)=gcd(n +d, n +2d)=gcd(n +d, d).\\n\\nWait, so actually, when m =n +d, the problem reduces to gcd(n +k, d) =1 for k=1 to d. So, all numbers from n +1 to n +d must be coprime with d.\\n\\nBut if d has any prime factor p, then in the interval [n +1, n +d], there must be a multiple of p. However, if n is congruent to -k mod p for some k in 1 to d, then n +k ≡0 mod p. Therefore, unless n ≡ -1, -2, ..., -d mod p, which is equivalent to n ≡ p -1, p -2, ..., p -d mod p. But if d ≥p, then p -d ≤0, so n would have to be in a certain residue class mod p. Wait, this might not be possible for all primes p dividing d.\\n\\nAlternatively, for each prime p dividing d, the numbers n +1, ..., n +d must not be divisible by p. But in an interval of d consecutive numbers, if p divides d, then since p ≤d, there must be a multiple of p in that interval. Therefore, if p divides d, then such an interval cannot avoid having a multiple of p, hence gcd(n +k, d) ≥p >1 for some k. Therefore, d must not have any prime factors, i.e., d=1. Therefore, the only solution is d=1, leading to m =n +1.\\n\\nTherefore, the conclusion is that all pairs where m =n +1 are the only solutions. Therefore, the answer is all pairs of consecutive positive integers where m =n +1.\\n\\nBut let me confirm with another approach. Suppose m =n +1. Then the conditions require gcd(n +1, n +2)=1, which is true. Also, the last gcd is gcd(m, 2m -n)=gcd(n +1, 2(n +1) -n)=gcd(n +1, n +2)=1. Since m -n =1, there\\'s only one gcd to check. So that works.\\n\\nIf m =n +d where d ≥2, then as we saw, the first gcd(n +1, n +d +1)=gcd(n +1, d). If we want this to be 1, then d must be coprime with n +1. But then, the next gcd(n +2, d) must also be 1, so d must be coprime with n +2. Continuing this way, d must be coprime with all numbers from n +1 to n +d. But d divides none of these numbers since they are all greater than d (if n ≥1). Wait, but d could be less than n +1. For example, if d=2 and n=2, then n +1=3, which is coprime with d=2. Then n +2=4, which is not coprime with d=2. So gcd(4, 2)=2≠1. Hence, invalid.\\n\\nAlternatively, if d=2 and n=1, then n +1=2 and n +2=3. gcd(2,2)=2≠1, so invalid. So even if n is chosen such that some of the gcds are 1, others will fail.\\n\\nAlternatively, take d=3, n=1: numbers 2,3,4. gcd(2,3)=1, gcd(3,3)=3≠1, gcd(4,3)=1. So fails.\\n\\nn=2, d=3: numbers 3,4,5. gcd(3,3)=3≠1. Fails.\\n\\nn=4, d=3: numbers 5,6,7. gcd(5,3)=1, gcd(6,3)=3≠1, gcd(7,3)=1. Fails.\\n\\nSo no matter how we choose n and d ≥2, there will always be some k where gcd(n +k, d) >1. Hence, only d=1 works. Therefore, the answer is all pairs where m =n +1.\\n\\nHence, the final answer is all pairs of positive integers (m, n) where m =n +1. So, in boxed form, we can represent the solution as all pairs where m =n +1, which is \\\\boxed{(n+1, n)} for all positive integers n. But the problem asks to \"determine all pairs m >n\", so the answer is all pairs where m =n +1, so the boxed answer should reflect that.\\n\\nBut the problem statement might expect us to write the pairs as (m, n) where m =n +1. So in boxed notation, we can write \\\\boxed{(k+1, k)} for each positive integer k. But the standard way to present all solutions is to write \\\\boxed{(m, n) \\\\text{ with } m = n + 1}.\\n\\nAlternatively, since the problem says \"determine all pairs\", and they want the answer in a specific format, likely \\\\boxed{(m, n) \\\\text{ where } m = n + 1}.\\n\\nBut I need to check if the problem expects a specific parametrization or just the general form.

Hmm, that seems a bit complex, but let me break it down step by step.\\n\\nFirst, let\\'s parse the problem statement again. We have pairs (m, n) with m > n, and for each k from 1 up to m - n, the gcd(n + k, m + k) should be 1. Wait, actually, the way it\\'s written is from gcd(n+1, m+1) to gcd(m, 2m - n). Let me check how many terms there are here.\\n\\nStarting with gcd(n+1, m+1): the first term is when we add 1 to both n and m. Then the next is gcd(n+2, m+2), and so on, up to gcd(m, 2m - n). Let me see how many terms this is. The first part is n+1, and the last part is m. So the number of terms is m - (n + 1) + 1 = m - n. Similarly, on the m side, the first term is m+1, and the last term is 2m - n. Let\\'s verify the number of terms here: (2m - n) - (m + 1) + 1 = 2m - n - m - 1 + 1 = m - n. So both sequences have m - n terms. Therefore, we have m - n gcd conditions that must all be equal to 1.\\n\\nSo, we need that for each integer k from 1 to m - n, gcd(n + k, m + k) = 1. Let me try to express m in terms of n and some difference. Let\\'s let d = m - n, since m > n, d is a positive integer. Then m = n + d. Let me substitute m with n + d in the equations. So, the pairs are (n + d, n) where n and d are positive integers, and we need gcd(n + k, n + d + k) = 1 for all k from 1 to d.\\n\\nWait, substituting m = n + d, then for each k from 1 to d, we have gcd(n + k, (n + d) + k) = gcd(n + k, n + k + d) = gcd(n + k, d). Because gcd(a, a + d) = gcd(a, d). Is that right? Let me confirm: gcd(a, a + d) = gcd(a, d). Yes, because any common divisor of a and a + d must divide their difference, which is d. So, indeed, gcd(a, a + d) = gcd(a, d). Therefore, in our case, gcd(n + k, d) = 1 for all k from 1 to d.\\n\\nBut n + k runs from n + 1 to n + d. So, we need that all integers from n + 1 to n + d are coprime with d. Therefore, for each integer x in the interval [n + 1, n + d], gcd(x, d) = 1.\\n\\nSo, this reduces the problem to finding all positive integers n and d such that every number from n + 1 to n + d is coprime with d. Then m = n + d, so our pairs would be (n + d, n).\\n\\nTherefore, the key is to find d and n such that n + 1, n + 2, ..., n + d are all coprime with d. So, what does this mean?\\n\\nIf all numbers from n + 1 to n + d are coprime with d, then none of these numbers can share a common factor with d greater than 1. So, in other words, d must be such that in any block of d consecutive integers, there exists some number divisible by a prime factor of d. Wait, but here we are choosing the block starting at n + 1, so we need that none of these numbers share a prime factor with d.\\n\\nAlternatively, for each prime p dividing d, none of the numbers n + 1, ..., n + d can be divisible by p. Therefore, for each prime p | d, the interval [n + 1, n + d] must not contain any multiple of p. But if d is the length of the interval, and p divides d, then p ≤ d. So, how can an interval of length d not contain a multiple of p? Since p divides d, but p ≤ d. Wait, in an interval of length d, starting at n + 1, if p divides d, then the numbers in the interval would be n + 1, n + 2, ..., n + d. If p divides d, then the spacing between multiples of p is p, so in any d consecutive numbers, since d is a multiple of p, there must be exactly d/p multiples of p. But if d is a multiple of p, then in an interval of d consecutive numbers, there are exactly d/p multiples of p. So unless n is chosen such that the interval [n + 1, n + d] skips all multiples of p. But if p divides d, then in such an interval, since d is a multiple of p, the numbers wrap around modulo p, so there must be a multiple of p in the interval. Wait, that seems conflicting.\\n\\nWait, more carefully: Consider that d is divisible by p. Then in any d consecutive integers, how many multiples of p are there? Exactly d/p, since every p-th number is a multiple. So, for example, if d = p, then there is exactly one multiple of p in any block of p consecutive numbers. Therefore, if we want an interval of length d (which is divisible by p) with no multiples of p, that\\'s impossible. Because in such an interval, you must have exactly d/p multiples, which would be at least 1. Therefore, if d has a prime factor p, then in any interval of d consecutive numbers, there is at least one multiple of p, hence gcd of that number with d would be at least p, which is greater than 1. Therefore, for the gcd(n + k, d) to be 1 for all k from 1 to d, it must be that d has no prime factors. But the only positive integer with no prime factors is 1. Therefore, d must be 1. Wait, that seems too restrictive. Let me check this reasoning again.\\n\\nSuppose d is a prime number, say d = p. Then in any interval of p consecutive numbers, there must be exactly one multiple of p. Hence, in the interval [n + 1, n + p], there is exactly one multiple of p. Therefore, unless that multiple is excluded, but since the interval has length p, we can\\'t avoid it. Therefore, if d is prime, then for any n, the interval [n + 1, n + p] contains exactly one multiple of p, so gcd of that number with p would be p, which is not 1. Hence, to have all gcds equal to 1, d must be 1. Because if d = 1, then the interval is just [n + 1], and gcd(n + 1, 1) is 1, since gcd any number with 1 is 1. Therefore, d = 1 is allowed.\\n\\nBut wait, if d = 1, then m = n + 1, and the only gcd to check is gcd(n + 1, m + 1) = gcd(n + 1, n + 2) = 1, which is always true. So, for any n, m = n + 1 is a solution. But the problem says \"determine all pairs m > n\", so if d = 1, then all pairs where m = n + 1 would work. But according to our earlier reasoning, if d has any prime factor, then in the interval [n + 1, n + d] there must be a multiple of that prime, hence gcd > 1. Therefore, d must be 1. Therefore, the only possible pairs are those with m = n + 1.\\n\\nWait, but let\\'s test with d = 2. Suppose d = 2. Then we need that n + 1 and n + 2 are both coprime with 2. So, gcd(n + 1, 2) = 1 and gcd(n + 2, 2) = 1. But n + 1 and n + 2 are consecutive integers. One of them must be even. Hence, one of the gcds would be 2, which is not 1. Therefore, d = 2 is impossible. Similarly, d = 3. Suppose d = 3. Then we need n + 1, n + 2, n + 3 all coprime with 3. So, in three consecutive numbers, none can be divisible by 3. But in any three consecutive numbers, exactly one is divisible by 3. Hence, impossible. Similarly, for d = 4. The interval [n + 1, n + 4] must have no even numbers? But since it\\'s four consecutive numbers, two of them are even. Hence, gcd with 4 would be at least 2. Therefore, impossible. Therefore, indeed, only d = 1 works. Hence, all pairs where m = n + 1 satisfy the condition.\\n\\nWait, but let me check a specific example. Let\\'s take d = 1. Then m = n + 1. Then we have to check gcd(n + 1, m + 1) = gcd(n + 1, n + 2) = 1, which is true because consecutive numbers are coprime. Since d = 1, there\\'s only one gcd to check. Therefore, this works.\\n\\nBut let\\'s test with d = 1, n = 1: m = 2. Check gcd(2, 3) = 1, which is good. Similarly, n = 2, m = 3: gcd(3, 4) = 1. So that works. So, indeed, all consecutive integer pairs satisfy the condition. But is that the only solution?\\n\\nWait, but let\\'s try d = 1, n = 1, m = 2: works. What if d = 2? Let me see if there\\'s any n where n + 1 and n + 2 are both coprime with 2. But in two consecutive numbers, one is even, so one of them would have gcd 2 with 2, which is not 1. Hence, no solution for d = 2.\\n\\nSimilarly, d = 3: need three consecutive numbers all coprime with 3. But in three consecutive numbers, one is divisible by 3, so that one would have gcd 3 with 3. Hence, no solution for d = 3.\\n\\nSo, in general, for d ≥ 2, since d has at least one prime factor, and in the interval [n + 1, n + d], there must be a multiple of each prime factor of d, hence making the gcd greater than 1. Therefore, only d = 1 works, leading to m = n + 1.\\n\\nTherefore, all pairs where m = n + 1 satisfy the given condition. But let me check if there\\'s another possibility where d is not 1, but maybe composite? Let\\'s take d = 6. Then, the prime factors are 2 and 3. In any interval of 6 consecutive numbers, there must be multiples of 2 and 3. For example, in [n + 1, n + 6], there are 3 even numbers, so gcd with 6 would be 2 or 3 or 6, so definitely not all 1. Hence, d = 6 is invalid.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe if d is a prime power? Let\\'s take d = 4 (which is 2^2). Then, in an interval of 4 numbers, we have two even numbers, so gcd with 4 would be at least 2 for those. So, again, not all 1.\\n\\nTherefore, it seems that only d = 1 works. Therefore, all pairs are m = n + 1. Hence, the solution is all consecutive integers with m = n + 1.\\n\\nWait, but let me check a case where d = 1. For example, n = 1, m = 2: gcd(2, 3) = 1. That works. n = 2, m = 3: gcd(3, 4) = 1. Also works. What about n = 3, m = 4: gcd(4, 5) = 1. Yes. So, all consecutive pairs. But the problem says \"all pairs m > n\", so this would be an infinite set of pairs where m is exactly one more than n.\\n\\nBut the problem says \"determine all pairs\", so the answer is all pairs where m = n + 1. Therefore, the solution is m = n + 1 for any positive integer n.\\n\\nBut wait, let me check the original problem again. The gcds start from gcd(n + 1, m + 1) up to gcd(m, 2m - n). So when m = n + 1, the last gcd is gcd(n + 1, 2(n + 1) - n) = gcd(n + 1, n + 2) = 1. Which is consistent. So, even the last gcd is 1. So, in this case, all the gcds are between consecutive integers, which are always coprime.\\n\\nTherefore, the conclusion is that all pairs where m = n + 1 satisfy the condition. Are there any other pairs?\\n\\nWait, let me test with m = n + 2, n = 1, m = 3. Then we need to check gcd(2, 4) = 2, which is not 1. So that fails. What about m = n + 3, n = 1, m = 4. Check gcd(2, 5) = 1, gcd(3, 6) = 3, which fails. So, only when m = n +1 does this hold.\\n\\nAlternatively, take m = n + 1. Then the sequence of gcds is gcd(n + 1, n + 2), gcd(n + 2, n + 3), ..., gcd(n + (m - n), n + (m - n) + (m - n)). Wait, when m = n +1, the difference d =1, so only one gcd: gcd(n +1, m +1) = gcd(n +1, n + 2) =1, which is correct.\\n\\nTherefore, yes, it seems that the only solutions are pairs where m = n +1.\\n\\nBut wait, let me think again. Suppose n and m are such that m = n +1. Then, the set of gcds required is from gcd(n +1, n + 2) up to gcd(n + (m -n), 2m -n). Since m -n =1, so only one gcd: gcd(n +1, 2(n +1) -n) = gcd(n +1, n +2) =1. So, indeed, it works.\\n\\nBut could there be a case where m -n is greater than1, but all the gcds still equal 1? For example, take m =5, n =2. Then m -n =3. So, the gcds to check are:\\n\\ngcd(3,6)=3, which is not 1. So, fails.\\n\\nAnother example: m =4, n=1. Then gcd(2,5)=1, gcd(3,6)=3≠1. So, fails.\\n\\nWait, how about m =5, n=3. Then d =2. The gcds are gcd(4,6)=2 and gcd(5,7)=1. So, first gcd is 2≠1, so invalid.\\n\\nAlternatively, m = 5, n=4. Then d=1. gcd(5,6)=1. That works.\\n\\nAnother example: m=6, n=5. d=1. gcd(6,7)=1. Works.\\n\\nBut if I take d=2, m =n +2, say n=5, m=7. Then check gcd(6,8)=2≠1, gcd(7,9)=1. So, first gcd fails.\\n\\nAlternatively, n=1, m=3. gcd(2,4)=2≠1. So, invalid.\\n\\nWait, so indeed, whenever d ≥2, the first gcd(n +1, m +1)=gcd(n +1, n + d +1)=gcd(n +1, d). Since m =n +d. Wait, gcd(n +1, n + d +1) = gcd(n +1, (n + d +1) - (n +1)) = gcd(n +1, d). So, to have gcd(n +1, d) =1. Similarly, the next gcd(n +2, m +2) = gcd(n +2, d) =1, and so on up to gcd(n +d, 2m -n) = gcd(n +d, 2(n +d) -n)=gcd(n +d, n +2d)=gcd(n +d, d).\\n\\nWait, so actually, when m =n +d, the problem reduces to gcd(n +k, d) =1 for k=1 to d. So, all numbers from n +1 to n +d must be coprime with d.\\n\\nBut if d has any prime factor p, then in the interval [n +1, n +d], there must be a multiple of p. However, if n is congruent to -k mod p for some k in 1 to d, then n +k ≡0 mod p. Therefore, unless n ≡ -1, -2, ..., -d mod p, which is equivalent to n ≡ p -1, p -2, ..., p -d mod p. But if d ≥p, then p -d ≤0, so n would have to be in a certain residue class mod p. Wait, this might not be possible for all primes p dividing d.\\n\\nAlternatively, for each prime p dividing d, the numbers n +1, ..., n +d must not be divisible by p. But in an interval of d consecutive numbers, if p divides d, then since p ≤d, there must be a multiple of p in that interval. Therefore, if p divides d, then such an interval cannot avoid having a multiple of p, hence gcd(n +k, d) ≥p >1 for some k. Therefore, d must not have any prime factors, i.e., d=1. Therefore, the only solution is d=1, leading to m =n +1.\\n\\nTherefore, the conclusion is that all pairs where m =n +1 are the only solutions. Therefore, the answer is all pairs of consecutive positive integers where m =n +1.\\n\\nBut let me confirm with another approach. Suppose m =n +1. Then the conditions require gcd(n +1, n +2)=1, which is true. Also, the last gcd is gcd(m, 2m -n)=gcd(n +1, 2(n +1) -n)=gcd(n +1, n +2)=1. Since m -n =1, there\\'s only one gcd to check. So that works.\\n\\nIf m =n +d where d ≥2, then as we saw, the first gcd(n +1, n +d +1)=gcd(n +1, d). If we want this to be 1, then d must be coprime with n +1. But then, the next gcd(n +2, d) must also be 1, so d must be coprime with n +2. Continuing this way, d must be coprime with all numbers from n +1 to n +d. But d divides none of these numbers since they are all greater than d (if n ≥1). Wait, but d could be less than n +1. For example, if d=2 and n=2, then n +1=3, which is coprime with d=2. Then n +2=4, which is not coprime with d=2. So gcd(4, 2)=2≠1. Hence, invalid.\\n\\nAlternatively, if d=2 and n=1, then n +1=2 and n +2=3. gcd(2,2)=2≠1, so invalid. So even if n is chosen such that some of the gcds are 1, others will fail.\\n\\nAlternatively, take d=3, n=1: numbers 2,3,4. gcd(2,3)=1, gcd(3,3)=3≠1, gcd(4,3)=1. So fails.\\n\\nn=2, d=3: numbers 3,4,5. gcd(3,3)=3≠1. Fails.\\n\\nn=4, d=3: numbers 5,6,7. gcd(5,3)=1, gcd(6,3)=3≠1, gcd(7,3)=1. Fails.\\n\\nSo no matter how we choose n and d ≥2, there will always be some k where gcd(n +k, d) >1. Hence, only d=1 works. Therefore, the answer is all pairs where m =n +1.\\n\\nHence, the final answer is all pairs of positive integers (m, n) where m =n +1. So, in boxed form, we can represent the solution as all pairs where m =n +1, which is \\\\boxed{(n+1, n)} for all positive integers n. But the problem asks to \"determine all pairs m >n\", so the answer is all pairs where m =n +1, so the boxed answer should reflect that.\\n\\nBut the problem statement might expect us to write the pairs as (m, n) where m =n +1.

Thus, the solution is \\\\boxed{(m, n) \\\\text{ where } m = n + 1}.\\n</think>\\n\\nTo determine all pairs \\\\( m > n \\\\) of positive integers such that\\n\\n$$\\n1 = \\\\gcd(n+1, m+1) = \\\\gcd(n+2, m+2) = \\\\cdots = \\\\gcd(m, 2m-n),\\n$$\\n\\nwe start by letting \\\\( d = m - n \\\\). This transforms the problem into finding pairs \\\\( (n + d, n) \\\\) such that \\\\(\\\\gcd(n + k, d) = 1\\\\) for all \\\\( k \\\\) from 1 to \\\\( d \\\\). This means that all numbers from \\\\( n + 1 \\\\) to \\\\( n + d \\\\) must be coprime with \\\\( d \\\\).\\n\\nFor each prime \\\\( p \\\\) dividing \\\\( d \\\\), the interval \\\\([n + 1, n + d]\\\\) must not contain any multiples of \\\\( p \\\\). However, in any interval of \\\\( d \\\\) consecutive numbers, there must be a multiple of \\\\( p \\\\) if \\\\( p \\\\leq d \\\\). This implies that \\\\( d \\\\) cannot have any prime factors, meaning \\\\( d \\\\) must be 1. Therefore, \\\\( m = n + 1 \\\\).\\n\\nTo verify, if \\\\( m = n + 1 \\\\), the gcd conditions reduce to checking \\\\(\\\\gcd(n + 1, n + 2) = 1\\\\), which is always true since consecutive integers are coprime. Thus, the only pairs \\\\( (m, n) \\\\) that satisfy the given conditions are those where \\\\( m = n + 1 \\\\).\\n\\nThe final answer is:\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\boxed{(m, n) \\\\text{ where } m = n + 1}\\n\\\\]'}"

      "Hmm, let me parse that again. The first journey (24 km upstream, 28 km downstream) took half an hour less than the journey with 30 km upstream and 21 km downstream. Alternatively, it took half an hour more than the journey with 15 km upstream and 42 km downstream. So, there are two comparisons here:\n",

However, given the repeating pattern we observed earlier, it seems the carryovers never terminate, leading to an infinite number of decimal places with 7s.

But we need the tenths place to be 0, so this is not acceptable. Wait, but actually, when summing in the tenths place, if the sum is 10, we get a carryover of 1 and 0 in the tenths place. So to get 10 in the tenths place, we need the sum of the tenths digits to be 10. But each digit is either 0 or 7, so 7 * k = 10. But 10 is not divisible by 7. Therefore, it's impossible.

      "Wait, but this would mean Numbers 1-6 cover the first six decimal places, and Numbers 7-8 cover the next ones. However, in this setup, each decimal place is covered by one number per cycle. For example, decimal place 1 is covered by Number 1, decimal place 2 by Number 2, etc. However, the required number of 7s in each decimal place varies:\n",

In decimal place 3, 2 sevens, so two of the 8 numbers have a 7 there. In decimal place 4, 8 sevens, so all 8 numbers have a 7 there.

Alternatively, use a binary matrix approach where each row represents a number and each column represents a decimal place, with 1 indicating a 7 and 0 indicating a 0.

      "1. **Understanding the Problem**:\n",
      "   - Each number must be less than 1 and have decimal digits 0 or 7.\n",
      "   - The sum of these numbers must be exactly 1.000...\n",
      "   - The key challenge is to handle the carryovers in each decimal place to achieve the total sum of 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Decimal Place Analysis**:\n",
      "   - For the tenths place, the sum must be 10 (to carryover 1 to the units place). This requires contributions from the tenths digits (0 or 7) and carryovers from the hundredths place.\n",
      "   - Each subsequent decimal place must sum to 0 considering carryovers from the next place.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Carryover Propagation**:\n",
      "   - The sum in each decimal place must be a multiple of 7, leading to a system of equations involving carryovers.\n",
      "   - The carryovers cycle through a repeating pattern, requiring careful management to ensure they eventually resolve to zero.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Key Observations**:\n",
      "   - The tenths place requires a sum of 10, leading to a carryover of 1 and resolving to 0.\n",
      "   - The hundredths place must handle a carryover of 3, requiring 4 sevens.\n",
      "   - Subsequent places follow a pattern of carryovers and sums, requiring varying numbers of 7s.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Cycle and Maximum Requirement**:\n",
      "   - The required number of 7s in each decimal place cycles through 1, 4, 2, 8, 5, 7, repeating every 6 places.\n",
      "   - The maximum number of 7s required in any single decimal place is 8.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Conclusion**:\n",
      "   - To cover all required 7s in each decimal place, especially the maximum requirement of 8 sevens in the ten-thousandths place, the minimal number \\( n \\) is 8.\n",

      "has the range . $\\qquad$\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Okay, let's try to figure out the range of this function. The function is f(x) = (sin x - 1) divided by the square root of (3 - 2 cos x - 2 sin x), and x is between 0 and 2π. Hmm, so I need to find all possible values that f(x) can take. \n",
      "\n",
      "First, let me understand the components of the function. The numerator is sin x - 1. Since sin x ranges between -1 and 1, sin x - 1 will range between -2 and 0. So the numerator is always non-positive, right? Because the maximum value of sin x is 1, so sin x -1 is at most 0, and the minimum is -2. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then the denominator is sqrt(3 - 2 cos x - 2 sin x). Since it's a square root, the expression inside must be non-negative. So 3 - 2 cos x - 2 sin x ≥ 0. Let me check if that's always true or if there are restrictions. Maybe we can simplify the expression inside the square root. \n",
      "\n",
      "Let me denote the denominator's expression as D = 3 - 2 cos x - 2 sin x. So D must be ≥ 0. Let's see if D can be written in a different form. Maybe factor or use some trigonometric identity. Hmm, 3 - 2 cos x - 2 sin x. Let me think... Maybe express it as 3 - 2(cos x + sin x). That's right, because both cos x and sin x have coefficients of -2. So D = 3 - 2(cos x + sin x). \n",
      "\n",
      "Now, cos x + sin x can be written as sqrt(2) sin(x + π/4) or something like that. The maximum value of cos x + sin x is sqrt(2), and the minimum is -sqrt(2). So 3 - 2(cos x + sin x) will range between 3 - 2*sqrt(2) and 3 + 2*sqrt(2). But since sqrt(2) is approximately 1.414, 3 - 2*1.414 ≈ 3 - 2.828 ≈ 0.172. So the minimum value inside the square root is about 0.172, which is positive, and maximum is about 5.828. Therefore, the denominator is always positive, so f(x) is defined for all x in [0, 2π]. That's good to know.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the function f(x) is (sin x - 1) divided by sqrt(3 - 2 cos x - 2 sin x), with numerator between -2 and 0, denominator between sqrt(3 - 2*sqrt(2)) and sqrt(3 + 2*sqrt(2)), which are approximately sqrt(0.172) ≈ 0.414 and sqrt(5.828) ≈ 2.414. So the denominator is always positive, so the entire function f(x) is non-positive. So the range will be from some negative number up to 0.\n",
      "\n",
      "But we need to find the exact range, not just approximate. Let's think about how to approach this. Maybe we can use substitution variables to simplify the expression. Let me set t = sin x and s = cos x. Then, we have the numerator as t - 1, and the denominator as sqrt(3 - 2s - 2t). But since t^2 + s^2 = 1, maybe we can express one variable in terms of the other. \n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, perhaps use a substitution like setting u = x + α for some α to simplify the expression. For example, since we have both sin x and cos x terms, we can write them as a single sine or cosine function. Let's recall that a sin x + b cos x can be written as R sin(x + φ), where R = sqrt(a^2 + b^2). In this case, in the denominator, we have -2 cos x - 2 sin x, which is like -2(cos x + sin x). So cos x + sin x can be written as sqrt(2) sin(x + π/4), as I mentioned earlier. Therefore, -2(cos x + sin x) = -2*sqrt(2) sin(x + π/4). Therefore, the denominator becomes sqrt(3 - 2(cos x + sin x)) = sqrt(3 - 2*sqrt(2) sin(x + π/4)). \n",
      "\n",
      "Hmm, maybe that's helpful. Let me write that down. So D = sqrt(3 - 2*sqrt(2) sin(x + π/4)). Then, the numerator is sin x - 1. Perhaps another substitution. Let me think. Let me set θ = x + π/4, then x = θ - π/4. Then sin x = sin(θ - π/4) = sin θ cos π/4 - cos θ sin π/4 = (sin θ - cos θ)/sqrt(2). Similarly, sin(x + π/4) = sin θ. Wait, maybe this can be helpful. Let's try.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let θ = x + π/4. Then, x = θ - π/4, so sin x = sin(θ - π/4) = (sin θ - cos θ)/sqrt(2). Then, the numerator sin x - 1 = [(sin θ - cos θ)/sqrt(2)] - 1. The denominator is sqrt(3 - 2*sqrt(2) sin θ). \n",
      "\n",
      "Hmm, not sure if this is making it easier. Maybe another approach. Let's consider f(x)^2, since the function is non-positive, squaring it would give us the square of the numerator over the denominator, which might be easier to handle. But since the numerator is negative and the denominator is positive, f(x) is non-positive, so the square would just be [(1 - sin x)^2]/[3 - 2 cos x - 2 sin x]. Maybe that's easier to work with.\n",
      "\n",
      "So let's compute [(1 - sin x)^2]/[3 - 2 cos x - 2 sin x]. Let's expand the numerator: (1 - 2 sin x + sin^2 x). The denominator is 3 - 2 cos x - 2 sin x. So let's see if we can relate the numerator and denominator.\n",
