## News

- 2024.10.29 We introduce **Llama Scope**, our first contribution to the open-source Sparse Autoencoder ecosystem. Stay tuned! Link: [Llama Scope: Extracting Millions of Features from Llama-3.1-8B with Sparse Autoencoders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20526)

- 2024.10.9 Transformers and Mambas are mechanistically similar in both feature and circuit level. Can we follow this line and find **universal motifs and fundamental differences between language model architectures**? Link: [Towards Universality: Studying Mechanistic Similarity Across Language Model Architectures](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.06672)

- 2024.5.22 We propose hierarchical tracing, a promising method to **scale up sparse feature circuit analysis** to industrial size language models! Link: [Automatically Identifying Local and Global Circuits with Linear Computation Graphs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.13868)

- 2024.2.19 Our first attempt on SAE-based circuit analysis for Othello-GPT leads us to **an example of Attention Superposition in the wild**!

## Installation

Currently, the codebase use [pdm](https://pdm-project.org/) to manage the dependencies, which is an alternative to [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/). To install the required packages, just install `pdm`, and run the following command:

```bash
pdm install
```

This will install all the required packages for the core codebase. Note that if you're in a conda environment, `pdm` will directly take the current environment as the virtual environment for current project, and remove all the packages that are not in the `pyproject.toml` file. So make sure to create a new conda environment (or just deactivate conda, this will use virtualenv by default) before running the above command. A forked version of `TransformerLens` is also included in the dependencies to provide the necessary tools for analyzing features.

If you want to use the visualization tools, you also need to install the required packages for the frontend, which uses [bun](https://bun.sh/) for dependency management. Follow the instructions on the website to install it, and then run the following command:

```bash
cd ui
bun install
```

`bun` is not well-supported on Windows, so you may need to use WSL or other Linux-based solutions to run the frontend, or consider using a different package manager, such as `pnpm` or `yarn`.

## Launch an Experiment

We provide both a programmatic and a configuration-based way to launch an experiment. The configuration-based way is more flexible and recommended for most users. You can find the configuration files in the [examples/configuration](https://github.com/OpenMOSS/Language-Model-SAEs/tree/main/examples/configuration) directory, and modify them to fit your needs. The programmatic way is more suitable for advanced users who want to customize the training process, and you can find the example scripts in the [examples/programmatic](https://github.com/OpenMOSS/Language-Model-SAEs/tree/main/examples/programmatic) directory.

To simply begin a training process, you can run the following command:

```bash
lm-saes train examples/configuration/train.toml
```

which will start the training process using the configuration file [examples/configuration/train.toml](https://github.com/OpenMOSS/Language-Model-SAEs/tree/main/examples/configuration/train.toml).

To analyze a trained dictionary, you can run the following command:

```bash
lm-saes analyze examples/configuration/analyze.toml --sae <path_to_sae_model>
```

which will start the analysis process using the configuration file [examples/configuration/analyze.toml](https://github.com/OpenMOSS/Language-Model-SAEs/tree/main/examples/configuration/analyze.toml). The analysis process requires a trained SAE model, which can be obtained from the training process. You may need launch a MongoDB server to store the analysis results, and you can modify the MongoDB settings in the configuration file.

Generally, our configuration-based pipeline uses outer layer settings as default of the inner layer settings. This is beneficial for easily building deeply nested configurations, where sub-configurations can be reused (such as device and dtype settings). More detail will be provided future.

## Visualizing the Learned Dictionary

The analysis results will be saved using MongoDB, and you can use the provided visualization tools to visualize the learned dictionary. First, start the FastAPI server by running the following command:

```bash
uvicorn server.app:app --port 24577 --env-file server/.env
```

Then, copy the `ui/.env.example` file to `ui/.env` and modify the `VITE_BACKEND_URL` to fit your server settings (by default, it's `http://localhost:24577`), and start the frontend by running the following command:

```bash
cd ui
bun dev --port 24576
```

That's it! You can now go to `http://localhost:24576` to visualize the learned dictionary and its features.

## Development

We highly welcome contributions to this project. If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to open an issue or a pull request. We are looking forward to hearing from you!

## Acknowledgement

The design of the pipeline (including the configuration and some training details) is highly inspired by the [mats_sae_training
](https://github.com/jbloomAus/mats_sae_training) project (now known as [SAELens](https://github.com/jbloomAus/SAELens)) and heavily relies on the [TransformerLens](https://github.com/TransformerLensOrg/TransformerLens) library. We thank the authors for their great work.
