# Visualization Frontend for Language-Model-SAEs

This is a rewritten version of visualization frontend, using [Tanstack](https://tanstack.com/) libraries. To use it, first ensure you have [bun](https://bun.sh/) installed and a visualization backend running at `http://your-url-to-backend`, and run

```bash
bun install
```

to install the necessary dependencies. Then, copy `.env.example` to `.env`, and fill in your backend url. Run

```bash
bun run dev
```

to start the development server.

We're also working to provide a docker configuration to make it more easy to start the visualization backend & frontend. Keep informed!
